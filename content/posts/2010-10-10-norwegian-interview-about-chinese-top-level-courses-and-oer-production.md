I met Martin Aasbrenn, a Norwegian doctor and medical educator, through
Twitter. Since then, we've had a number of interesting discussions about
the production and use of Open Educational Resources online, and we had
a chance to meet up last summer to continue these conversations. I
always think I am busy myself, but here is a guy with a full job, a
bunch of extra responsibilities, and two little kids, who still finds
time to reflect, write, share and contribute to these open discussions â€“
I have a lot of respect for that!

After reading my [thesis](http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses), he
said that he found several interesting ideas in it, and wanted to share
these with a Norwegian audience. He did a Skype interview with me in
Norwegian, touching on a number of the points in the thesis, as well as
some of my thoughts about how we can make academic work more accessible,
and some of the experiments I am doing with disseminating the thesis. He
made [a raw transcript of the
conversation](https://docs.google.com/document/edit?id=1klPBzrj9Wz-bJZBg6tyOm3I6ZtcFd1Fw7HBbNP6glBU&authkey=CPDgrbgM&hl=en&pli=1#),
and has began to blog about it on [his
blog](http://forelesning.blogspot.com/) about teaching in higher ed. His
first post is about my typology of OER based on four purposes, read [his
post](http://forelesning.blogspot.com/2010/10/hvis-man-skal-diskutere-om-et-kurs-er.html),
and then [the original text from the
thesis](http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/09/17/categorizing-oer-based-on-four-purposes/).

I would love to see a discussion among Norwegian educators about my
research, and whether some of the ideas from China's project can be
applicable in Norway. Thanks a lot Martin, for helping me spread the
word.

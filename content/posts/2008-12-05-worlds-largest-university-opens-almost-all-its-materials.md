**Background**

[![ image](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/110/285647746_5a625f3997_m.jpg)](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/110/285647746_5a625f3997_m.jpg)India
is a country that I can never figure out. As striking as the poverty and
mismanagement was when I visited it this summer, I am continually struck
by the stream of innovation and wonderful initiatives coming from
institutions and individuals. I have written earlier about the [open
access to primary school
textbooks](http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/04/06/many-great-free-textbooks-from-india/)
in Hindi and English, the [Open Source Fellowships
workshop](http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/08/11/opensource-fellowships-and-localization-into-indic-languages-at-sarai/)
at [SARAI](http://www.sarai.net/), the [Universal
Library](http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/08/03/openlibrary-and-universal-library-guys-work-together/),
and finally the [OpenCourseWare
initiative](http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/04/06/opencourseware-around-the-world-china-and-india/)
from the Indian Institutes of Technology on
[Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/nptelhrd). I also gave a [talk in
Delhi](http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/08/14/talk-at-iipa-in-delhi-on-open-research-oer-and-open-learning-in-developing-countries-slidecast/)
on open education and open research for developing countries.

[Indira Gandhi National Open University](http://www.ignou.ac.in/)
(IGNOU) is the national distance learning university in India, and has
1.8 million students, served through over [1804 Study
Centres](http://www.ignou.ac.in/divisions/rsd/rstd2.htm) coordinated by
[58 Regional Centres](http://www.ignou.ac.in/divisions/rsd/rstd1.htm).
On their website they state that they are the largest university in the
world. I have heard that [China Central Radio and TV
University](http://www.ilo.org/public/english/employment/skills/hrdr/init/chn_2.htm)
might have as many as 2,6 million students, but I believe these are
distributed over the 44 regional Radio and TV Universities. Either way,
they are both massive systems!

**An amazing amount of rich materials - videos**

[![ image](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/173/426578345_5f9deac8fe_m.jpg)](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/173/426578345_5f9deac8fe_m.jpg)Just
this summer, IGNOU has launched two different portals, whose richness of
material I believe to be unparalleled in the OER world! Similar to the
IITs, it has [archived its videos on
Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=egyankoshIGNOU&view=subscriptions).
With one channel for each “school” within the university (for example
[School of education](http://www.youtube.com/user/ignousoe), [School of
social sciences](http://www.youtube.com/user/ignousoss), etc), more than
thousand half an hour/hour long videos have been posted. (And some
channels only have an introductory video, so it can be surmised that
perhaps as much as double the amount will eventually be posted). These
videos are from TV programs that have earlier been produced for
dissemination through satellite channels and by VHS, and sometimes the
quality is a bit poor, but the breadth is spectacular.

I do find the IIT videos great, but this offering has me much more
exciting, because it covers all fields. I have a feeling that there is a
lot less culture in how to teach elementary physics, than in teaching
about education, sociology and history, and for me this material is
uniquely Indian and provides us a wonderful glimpse into another
educational system and culture.

Most of the videos are in English, which is the common language of
higher education in India, but there are also substantial collections in
Hindi, especially in the humanities. For me, who is learning Hindi, this
is a great motivation to learn more Hindi, and probably the only place I
would easily come across lecture materials on a wide range of topics in
the language. Here is one example on the universalization of primary
education, which we have just been learning about in class this term:

There should really be something here for everyone. Here are many more
examples:

  (Women and social change in India)

**Document repository**

[![ image](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3247/2610688098_abf68e06b8_m.jpg)](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3247/2610688098_abf68e06b8_m.jpg)Not
only has IGNOU released a huge slew of very interesting filmed lectures,
but they have digitalized and made open access almost all of their
teaching materials! We are not talking about curriculum lists and some
course PDFs, this is the entire teaching material that a student would
encounter, all modules written by IGNOU staff.

They are employing a T-Space repository, and offer over 16,000
documents, most from 10-50 pages long. Here is a list of the different
schools, and the number of documents available:

-   [School of
  Agriculture](http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/3632) [660]
-   [School of Computer and Information
  Sciences](http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/3) [741]
-   [School of Continuing
  Education](http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/4) [1574]
-   [School of Education](http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/5)
  [1133]

-   [School of Sciences](http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/10)
  [3579]
-   [School of Social
  Sciences](http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/11) [5099]
-   [School of Social
  Work](http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/14175) [582]
-   [School of Tourism and Hospitality Service Sectoral
  Management](http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/14167) [408]

The richness of this documentation is astounding, and because of it’s
position both in India, and as a distance university, there are many
unique collections:

-   87 documents on [Distance
  Education](http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/11023),
  including an [economic analysis of the China Radio and TV
  University](http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/26002) (50
  pages), [research on distance education in
  India](http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/26087) (30
  pages), and [cost effectiveness of distance education in
  Asia](http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/25997) (22 pages).
-   21 documents on [Rural Development in the Indian
  Context](http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/2687)
-   58 documents on [Cyber
  Law](http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/19297)
-   60 documents on [Disaster
  Management](http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/5143)
-   79 documents on [HIV Family
  Education](http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/18734)
-   23 documents on [Indian Economic
  Policy](http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/1700)
-   38 documents on [History of the Indian
  Economy](http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/972)
-   32 documents on [Sociology in
  India](http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/1608)
-   141 documents on [Women’s empowerment and
  development](http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/3502)

…I could go on. Most of these documents are scanned PDFs that have been
OCRed (you can do full-text search on them, and you can copy and paste
text).

As you can see, I am extremely excited about this initiative. I don’t
think I am exaggerating when I state that this is the single largest (by
far) source of current open educational resources that exists (ie. not
counting the out of copyright books scanned by Google and OCA). Instead
of providing just a curriculum list with links to books and articles
that you cannot access if you are not member of a rich university, it
provides everything. And in addition, you get a wealth of material that
is unique to India/Asia, etc.

We often ask ourselves “do we need every institution to produce OCW”?
Well, if we are talking about a hundred “101 Intro to Economics” at
North-American institutions, then the answer is certainly no. But I
would love to read the intro to Sociology from Nigeria, the Pedagogical
survey from Hong Kong University, and the economics of small businesses
from South Africa!

**How could this be even better?**

Yes,
it is amazing, but it is amazing 1.0. A simple act could exponentially
raise the amazingness (I apologize for the lack of academic language).
Currently, all this material is in scanned PDFs (luckily OCRed) sitting
in a T-Space repository. A number of downloads (but far from all)
require a free registration, for some reason, and a very few are not
available even with that registration (almost all I clicked were
available though). However, all the material is copyrighted. *“Items in
eGyanKosh are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved by IGNOU,
unless otherwise indicated.”*

If instead all the material was licensed under a Creative Commons
license, here’s what we could do: Begin finding great documents,
extracting the text (Ctrl+A plus copy and paste gives you the OCRed
text, then you just need to edit it to make it look OK and fix typos)
and importing it into a Wiki - for example [Connexions](http://cnx.org).
That way, the documents would be so much more reusable. We could begin
tagging them, breaking them into parts, hyperlinking between them,
linking out to other content on the web, and creating an extremely rich
resource for future open courses, as well as self-learners.

And in the process, we might be improving the original texts, something
that IGNOU themselves could benefit from. Right now, I am not sure if
it’s under Copyright because IGNOU hasn’t considered the options, or
whether they made a conscious decision to Copyright it. I would love to
find out, and I hope that [Creative Commons India](http://cc-india.org)
could play a role here.

**What can we do? Use it!**

IGNOU has given a wonderful gift to humanity. The best way we can
support them, is to talk about it, and to use it. I am sure that some
[Peer2Peer University](http://p2pu.org) courses will benefit extremely,
but I would also love to see some of my classes assign readings from
this material. I think it would be a wonderful reversal of the near
one-way flow of scholarship and teaching materials (”from the West to
the Rest”) if classes at University of Toronto used IGNOU material. Not
just because it’s free, but because it’s very good - and relevant. I am
sure that this would strengthen IGNOU’s belief in going open (and
perhaps convince them to become [open “libre” and not just
“gratis”](http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2008/08/greengold-oa-and-gratislibre-oa.html)),
and perhaps show some Western institutions that if they don’t want to
lose the battle for mindshare completely, they also have to open up.

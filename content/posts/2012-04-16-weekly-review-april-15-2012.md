I began last week to do a "[weekly
review](http://reganmian.net/blog/2012/04/08/weekly-review-april-8-2012/)",
and it seemed like a useful thing to continue. This week, I've been at
[AERA
2012](http://www.aera.net/AnnualMeetingsOtherEvents/AnnualMeeting2012Details/tabid/10209/Default.aspx),
 so this will be a mix of what I did before I left on Thursday, and some
of the notes I've taken at the conference (which is still going on for
another day).

**Readings**

I continued reading several papers by [Paul
Bouchard](http://paulbouchard.blogspot.com/) at the University of
Concordia about adult self-directed learners, and two critiques of human
capital theory. In total, I now have high-level notes on [[a:Paul
Bouchard|13 of his papers on his author page]].

I revisited Joe Corneli and Charlie Danoff's work on "[[paragogy]]", and
I've read [[paragogy|eight of their papers]]. I still need to read more,
including Howard Rheingold and his group's [work on
peeragogy](http://socialmediaclassroom.com/host/peeragogy/), which
builds closely on paragogy, but I find many of the ideas very
interesting.

I also read

-   [@abedin2011online] about Web 2.0 and learning
-   [@alevizou2010distributed] about three P2PU courses, and
  [@deliddo2010method] on using Cohere to analyze learning in a P2PU
  course
-   [@bacsich2011learner], a large report about research on
  learner-interaction with OER from the UK
-   [@mcandrew2010defining] on the changing definitions of openess with
  the Open University in the UK, and [@weller2001scaling] on scaling
  up an Open University course to reach 12,000 students with more than
  500 tutors
-   [@schejbal2012search] on challenges for universities in the 21st
  century
-   a number of papers on MOOCs and personal learning networks:
  [@dewaard2011using], [@fournier2011researching],
  [@fournier2011value], [@kop2008connectivism] and
  [@kop2010networked].

**AERA**

I spent several days at AERA, and used the wiki to take notes at some of
the sessions. However, the daily schedule here is quite exhausting, and
there were also sessions that were not that relevant to my research,
lack of battery etc, which meant that I did not take notes of that many
sessions. So far I have [[Aera12:start|notes from four sessions]]
(usually with five presentations each), including two about
[[self-regulated learning]], one about [[wikis in education]], and one
about computer-supported collaborative learning.

I also had a chance to meet with [Ryan
Muller](http://learnstream.org/wiki/), another user of Researchr, and we
had a great four-hour walk through Stanley park and Granville Island
discussing possible future ideas for Researchr, Open Access publishing,
etc. I also met with [Heather
Morrison](http://poeticeconomics.blogspot.ca/) and [Heather
Piwowar](http://www.researchremix.org/wordpress/), both very active in
Open Access from different perspectives, and had very exciting
conversations with them - expect to see more about that in the future.

**Researchr**

As usual, I couldn't quite avoid stealing in some time to work on
[Researchr](http://reganmian.net/wiki/researchr:start), and I made [15
commits](https://github.com/houshuang/folders2web/compare/a2da690794054936b467853154bd4fa49dd538a7...a4e076fb6d4cda03cfaf24095e6f703523234787).

In addition to the weekly review, I felt the need for a space to keep
unstructured notes and ideas for future processing. I thought it would
be really nice if I could capture the context in which these notes had
been made, and I used a modification of the cleanup script I introduced
last week to automatically output a list of the articles and pages I had
been working on during the last 24 hours, as a proxy for my "mental
context" at the time of taking the notes. This
[script](https://github.com/houshuang/folders2web/blob/master/idealog.rb)
isn't quite finished yet, but [[Idealog:12:04:09|here is an example of
how it works]].

I spent quite a lot of time implementing "semantic" search and
trackbacks with proper titles for articles pages, which I [wrote up on
my
blog](http://reganmian.net/blog/2012/04/11/semantic-researchrdokuwiki-search/),
and finally I made a bunch of minor fixes, cleanups etc, including
making the clip and clip-again scripts [more robust and with nicer
output](https://github.com/houshuang/folders2web/commit/861935bf8e18642a27edd8f33b76e08bc4313d83).

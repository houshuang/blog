The untiring Stephen Downes has a new course coming up, ["Personal
Learning Environments Networks and Knowledge
2010"](http://connect.downes.ca/index.html). This topic interests me a
great deal, and is also something I will probably be visiting in my PhD
program, which I will begin in a few weeks. If this were a traditional
course, I would not be able to commit to a specific schedule of
readings, contributions etc. However, with a connectivist course, you
take what you need, and give what you can (or feel like), and popping in
and out of the course is not frowned upon. I did sign up for the
EdFutures course, and although I was quite unable to follow all the
discussions, I still got some very interesting insights (and made one
important new contact) from the experience, so it was absolutely worth
it. I have also signed up for this course, and look forward to the
discussions that will happen.

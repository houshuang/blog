first became aware of the process of unionizing the workers at SODEXHO
during a meeting, where we were shown the excellent movie
[“Occupation”](http://www.enmassefilms.org/occupation.htm) about
students staging a sit-in at Harvard university - the second wealthiest
non-profit in the world, after the Vatican - to fight for living wages
for the university staff. They also told us about SODEXHO - a French
multinational which runs catering businesses in many countries, and even
used to operate prisons in the US (but had to divest themselves of that
investment, because of student protest). They run most of the food
operations at St. George, UofT’s downtown campus, including the Robart’s
library canteen. Apparently, the staff was paid incredibly low wages
(chefs with 15 years ansiennity would be paid 8\$/hr), and they were
also harassed and discriminated against regularly.

I was briefly involved in a campaign to support the workers in their
drive to unionize, but never participated much. Today I saw the news in
the canteen that the workers approved unionization, and a contract, with
98% of the votes in favor. This is great news, and I am very happy for
the workers! I also thank all the students, faculty and outside
supporters who contributed to this process.

read a book called [“Underground
Woman”](http://www.temple.edu/tempress/titles/1303_reg.html) about a
woman who worked for the Transit Authority on the New York subways for
four years, while doing her graduate work. She subsequently became a
sociologist, and wrote a (not too academic) account of her work,
focusing on being a woman, but more in general on harassment by riders,
perceptions of management, and a horrible union that didn’t help anyone.

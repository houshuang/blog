At [Beyond the PDF 2](http://www.force11.org/beyondthepdf2) in Amsterdam, the organizers announced a round of microgrants and asked us to use the hashtag #1k to apply for them. Inspired by [Martin Fenner's blog post](http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2012/12/13/a-call-for-scholarly-markdown/), and my own experiments with scholarly authoring, I posted the following:

After a vote, this "project" was [chosen](http://www.force11.org/node/4358) as one of the winners. [Martin Fenner](http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/) graciously agreed to co-organize it with me, and 8th of June we're organizing a workshop/meeting/unconference/hackathon on Scholarly Markdown in San Francisco. Sign up [on Eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/6592206467), and add your information to [the wiki](https://github.com/karthikram/markdown_science/wiki/people-attending). We're also using the wiki to collect ideas (we'd love to hear from you even if you can't make it in person!).

Here's the description from the Eventbrite page:

*Please join us for a full day of presentations, discussions and coding around Markdown for scholarly content. Some of the potential outcomes of the workshop include:
notes from discussion about the suitability of Markdown for scientific authoring (different stages, disciplines, etc)*

- comprehensive list of tools/initiatives
- notes from discussion about collaboration/synergy between tools
- list of interesting examples/showcase (GH repositories etc)
- list of "barriers", "obstacles" etc
- notes from discussion about way forward, applying for grants, etc

The event is supported by a 1K Force11 Challenge prize.

Please add your background and ideas to the [wiki](https://github.com/karthikram/markdown_science/wiki/people-attending). And please contact the organizers @houshuang and @mfenner if you want to give a presentation or demo.*

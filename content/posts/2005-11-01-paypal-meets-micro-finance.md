This is simply awesome! I wish I had thought of that;
[Kiva](http://www.kiva.org/about.php) is a website gives you the option
to make direct microcredit loans to small entrepreneurs in developing
countries. You can choose to donate as little as 25\$ through Paypal,
and throughout the duration of the loan (usually 6-12 months) you get
updates from the business, photos of new capital equipment etc. When the
loan is repaid, you get the money back, if the business defaults, it
becomes converted into a charitable donation. No business has defaulted
so far though.

I am definitively going to sign up for this. Capitalism here I come.

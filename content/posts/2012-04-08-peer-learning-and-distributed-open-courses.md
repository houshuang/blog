I was a Teaching Assistant for a Knowledge Media and Design Institute
course on Knowledge Media and Learning this term, and during the last
class, I got invited to give a one hour overview of open courses. I put
together a presentation which reused some of my old material, but also
looked at the new offerings from Stanford and MIT, and the various
"precursors" for these projects, academically and otherwise. You can
find the slides below (or on Slideshare), and you can [download the
MP3](http://reganmian.net/files/Peer_Learning290312.mp3).

Welcome back. Sorry that we are slightly behind on the bi-weeklies, but
all shall be summarized here.

Last week, we discussed scaffolding, and read a really interesting
article:

-   Puntambekar, S. *[Scaffolding in Complex Learning Environments: What
  we have gained and what we have
  missed?](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.23.7454&rep=rep1&type=pdf)*

Stian [[ref:puntambekar2002scaffolding|summarized the article]], and
[blogged about
it](http://reganmian.net/blog/2011/06/04/scaffolding-and-support-for-collaborative-learning/).
Nate [also blogged about
it](http://ottonomy.net/blog/2011/06/04/scaffolding-for-learning-on-training-wheels/).

Stian also posted [about
Cohere](http://reganmian.net/blog/2011/05/28/cohere-a-prototype-for-contested-collective-intelligence/)
from the week before.

We had a very [engaging meeting](http://piratepad.net/cscl6), discussing
the article.

We've also had some active discussion on the task pages about
[badges](http://new.p2pu.org/en/groups/introduction-to-the-field-of-computer-supported-co/content/how-to-participate-in-this-class/),
and the [meta-discussion on course
components](http://new.p2pu.org/en/groups/introduction-to-the-field-of-computer-supported-co/content/meta-discussion-on-course-contentcomponents/).

We've only got two weeks left - it would be really great to go out with
a bang, and not with whimper, so I'd really appreciate it if you tried
to be active for these last two weeks, and I'd love to see a bunch of
blog posts about the different CSCL systems mentioned in [Week
7](http://new.p2pu.org/en/groups/introduction-to-the-field-of-computer-supported-co/content/wk-7-cases-knowledge-forum-wise-math-forum-compendium-embedded-phenomena-immersive-enviros/).

This week we will hopefully have a guest presentation by [Sandy
McAuley](http://www.upei.ca/~amcauley/), who has worked with Knowledge
Forum (did his PhD with Scardamalia), indigenous communities, and lately
also been involved in work around MOOCs. We are still waiting to
confirm, but hopefully he will be able to join us at our normal meeting
time on Saturday.

PS: Happy [Duanwu
Festival](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duanwu_Festival), which we
celebrated by making dumplings with a local family.

![Taiwan cover
page](http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0801488052.01._AA400_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg)I
picked up [Taiwan: A Political
History](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0801488052/qid=1114492280/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/102-2030066-0621712?v=glance&s=books&n=507846)
by Denny Roy while I was browsing idly in the [Munk
Center](http://www.utoronto.ca/mcis) library - looking for something to
read over an impending Chinese lunch. In fact, I’ve wanted to know more
about Taiwan’s history for quite a while, and this was a good
opportunity. Good book - told me a lot of things that I didn’t know.

-   How Taiwan wasn’t regarded as part of China throughout history, and
  emigration was even forbidden by the Chinese government.
-   The struggles (and sometimes conviviality) between Chinese settlers
  and native populations
-   How China gave up Taiwan to Japan under the terms of the Treaty of
  Shimonoseki of 1895
-   Taiwan under Japan, almost fifty years. The transformation from
  disparate ethnic groups to a feeling of Taiwanness. Trying to
  control the natives. Forced use of the Japanese language. Taiwanese
  who struggled against/collaborated with Japanese. Rapid
  modernization. Not part of Japan, not rights of Japanese citizen -
  occupied territority.
-   Still lot’s of experimentation with self-government, gradually
  gained more representation. Especially towards the war, when Japan
  was loosing legitimacy. Preparation for later democracy… Some
  Taiwanese fight for Japan in war.
-   Japanese leaving and Chiang Kai-Shek’s people taking over (before
  they have to abandon the mainland).
-   Taiwanese seen as traitors (even though China gave them willingly to
  Japan), “not to be trusted”… Treated very poorly.
-   KMT moves to island. Separation mainlanders / taiwanese (those who
  had been there before 1949).
-   Military dictatorship. Mainlanders in most positions of power.
-   China would have invaded if not for the Korea war? This also makes
  US care more about fate of Taiwan.
-   Initially China was more positive about rapproachment, Taiwan was
  the tough one. Cut diplomatic ties with countries that recognized
  PRC unilaterally etc.
-   UN - after several years of Albania rising the issue, finally
  accepts PRC. US tries to convince Taiwan to accept dual
  representation, but they issue ultimatum. Leave UN, and all UN
  organizations, hours before the vote (voluntarily).
-   Death of Chiang Kai-Shek 1975, son Chiang Ching-Kong. Gradual move
  towards democracy. Democratic Progress Party first independent
  party. Then president elected by people.
-   First Lee Deng-Hui: did a lot of good, but quelled inner-party
  democracy, a bit of a Machiavellian. Very unpopular with mainland.
-   Chen Shui-Bian, first non-KMT president. Firebrand. First president
  born in Taiwan.

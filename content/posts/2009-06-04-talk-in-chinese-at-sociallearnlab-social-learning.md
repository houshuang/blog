[SocialLearnLab](http://sociallearnlab.org/) (or 教育大发现, which is
their Chinese name) is a unique online community of students, professors
and teachers interested in online education, Web 2.0 and open education.
Initiated by Beijing Normal University professor Zhuang Xiaoli
([庄秀丽](http://sociallearnlab.org/blog/)), they run several very
active mailing lists, wikis, and use a number of Chinese and
international social networking apps. I am hoping do to an interview
with professor Zhuang later, to talk more about the background for this
organization. Anyway, while in Beijing I hoped to be able to meet up
with people interested in these topics, and we managed to organize a
"salon", with participants from several Beijing universities, as well as
many students from Beijing Normal. I began by giving a "short" talk (I
planned it for half an hour, but it became an hour), and then we had
time after that to discuss and share.

I posted the talk on Slideshare, with audio synched to the slides. This
is my third talk that I have given in China, and they are all different
(although some issues recur). In this case, I assumed that many of the
people would be quite familiar with the basic issues, and I also knew
from the mailing list that several had watched [my earlier presentation
at
CMU](http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/05/25/new-talk-in-chinese-understanding-the-meaning-of-open-education-expanding-the-definition-of-oer/),
so I decided to discuss some more detailed issues. I spent some time on
talking about the progress in setting up [Peer2Peer
University](http://peer2peeruniversity.org), and also discussed the open
education blogosphere as an epistemic community, and compared my view of
the Chinese and English-language "spheres". It turned out that many of
the participants were not that familiar with many of the concepts
however, and we spent some time after my talk to discuss things like
open access, and open licenses, more in detail.

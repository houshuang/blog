*Update: I apologize for a) posting a broken link and b) taking so long
to fix it. Thank you to those who pointed it out, and please try again,
itâ€™s worth it.*

I just found out that the excellent documentary on the sit-in at
Harvard, that I mentioned in the last post, is [available
online](http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2478089?htv=12)! I highly
recommend that you take 42 minutes out of your busy schedules, and watch
this. Very inspiring. If you can, get a hold of a high-quality copy, and
show this at your campus, club meeting or other. It needs to be spread!

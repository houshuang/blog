In an [interesting article in the New
Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/critics/atlarge/articles/051010crat_atlarge),
Malcolm Gladwell discusses the history of the admission systems for the
Ivy League schools in the US, especially focusing on Harvard. One of his
points is that the admissions procedure was changed from one focusing
purely on academic merit to one focusing more on “the whole person”
(references, interview, etc) because the percentage of Jews admitted was
fast increasing. He ends by concluding that Harvard is being managed
like a “luxury-brand”; drawing parallells to how the manufacturer of a
high-end sports car wouldn’t want mostly black women to drive around in
them, since they would lover the perception of the brand.

Fascinating.

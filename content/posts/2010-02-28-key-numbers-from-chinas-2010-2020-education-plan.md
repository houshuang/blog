In 2001, I spent a year teaching English in Wuhan University of Science
and Technology. That certainly gave me a first flavor of Chinese
university life, but I still understood very little about the Chinese
higher education system - partly because that university was a
private-public venture, which (at least my campus) seemed to focus more
on training than education, let alone research. Also, my Chinese was not
good enough at that time to really understand all that went on. In the
last two years, I've been researching a large Open Educational Resource
project in Chinese higher education for my MA. During this time, I've
had a chance to visit many Chinese universities, interact with Chinese
professors and MA students, give some lectures, read a number of
academic articles, etc.

I've also had reason to learn more about the history and development of
Chinese higher education, since this is very related to my research
(which is in comparative education). Finally, because I am in general
interested in higher education, and have been amazed at the rapid
progress of the Chinese system, I've tried to understand more about the
national debate.

Recently, I was made aware of a report called the "National Outline for
Medium and Long-term Education Reform and Development (2010-2020)"
(国家中长期教育改革和发展规划纲要), which will lay out the direction of
Chinese education for the next ten years. This report has been more than
a year in the making, with a large amount of public consultations,
online consultations, and a series of expert roundtables, where both the
Minister of Education, and the Prime Minister of China have
participated.

Most of my research, and interest, is around higher education, so I will
focus on that. During the Cultural Revolution, higher education was
essentially suspended, and it only reopened in 1977, with the
relaunching of the national unified exam. This was also the beginning of
the 30 years of opening, which is currently celebrated in China. In the
1990's, the government instituted large projects like [Project
985](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_985) and
[Project 211](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_211) to increase the
quality of education, and introduce communications technology into
higher education. 1999 saw the beginning of an explosive growth in the
system, which led to the 4 million enrolled students when I was teaching
in 2001 becoming 27 million enrolled students in 2009.

So what do the next ten years hold? So far, the news that has been most
widely reported is the idea that universities will become more
independent from the government. I might blog more after I've read the
report (it's quite long), but for now, I thought I'd repost, and
translate, their table over how key numbers will change from 2010 to
2020. The entire report can be found
[here](http://www.moe.gov.cn/edoas/website18/zhuanti/2010zqyj/zqyjg.htm#_Toc254687644)
(in a horrible Word-converted HTML file, which uses 2.7 MB to present
80KB worth of text). I didn't find many English news articles about the
report, but there are some mentions from domestic media

A few things which I noticed. The participation rate of students goes up
drastically (from 25% to 40%), but the number of students does not. This
must mean that demographic predictions show a large decrease in cohort
sizes. This is natural, given the lowering birthrates, but I didn't
expect it to be so clear. That will have a huge impact on the Chinese
labor market in the future. I am also curious about how the much higher
level of general education among the labor force in 2020, including a
doubling in the amount of working-age people with a university degree,
will have on all aspects of Chinese society.

This also explains why the expansion of Chinese higher education has now
more or less stopped - I thought it was because they were not planning
to raise participation rate strongly during the next few years, but in
fact, with an increase in enrolment of just 16% over 10 years (nothing
for a system that six-doubled enrolment in the previous ten years),
China can reach a participation rate of 40%, which is very respectable
internationally. This also means that all the new money coming into the
system (another important number is that they want to raise investment
in education to 4% of GDP - this of course a GDP that itself increases
by 8-12% per year) will go to improve access (there is much talk about
fairness and access in the plan) and quality.

Also interesting that they are not planning to increase the number of
distance education students (this is my inference from the gap between
students and students on campus). This is congruent with what I have
heard from friends, that China is trying to reorient it's substantial
distance-education system from it's previous role as a stop-gap from a
higher education system that did not have space for everyone who wanted
to study, to a tool for implementing life-long learning. This is also
seen from the very ambitious figures for life-long learning (350M
employed persons participating in life-long learning by 2020!).

The only kind of higher education which will increase rapidly in numbers
is the number of graduate students, which will grow by 42% in real
terms. Given the predicted smaller cohorts, this will mean a very large
increase in the percentage of students with graduate degrees.

Given that this is a report focused on education, and not research, it
doesn't say anything about the growth in professors, researchers etc.
There is another report focusing on the growth of science and technology
from 2006 to 2020, which might talk more about this. These are the only
numbers in the report (in a table format), the other parts seem to be
much more oriented to ideals and directions, rather than measurable
targets. But I will write more when I've read the whole thing.

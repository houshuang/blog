I am currently listening to the [Introduction to
Sociology](http://reganmian.net/vu/#SOC101) course from the [Virtual
University of Pakistan](http://vu.edu.pk), whose video lectures I
described in a [previous
post](http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/05/21/the-virtual-university-of-pakistan-has-6000-hours-of-video-lectures-on-youtube/).
The course is taught by Dr. Muhammad Anwar, and curious to find some
information about him, I googled his name. I came across
[this](http://www.cssforum.com.pk/css-optional-subjects/group-b/sociology/21098-audio-lectures-sociology-dr-muhammad-anwar.html)
discussion about his course, where former students are praising him
highly. Tauqir Mehmood Wattoo said:

> i have to tell my forum fellows just one thing that i have been a
> student of dr anwar. he is an authority in sociology and specially in
> social research.
>
> those choosing sociology must go through these lectures.

Raz replies:

> I second your opinion. I didn’t know about Dr. Anwar’s expertise over

> Two main benefits of VU lectures: 1) To the point and time saving 2)

> from any risk).

Further down, I found out that the textbooks for this class (and all
other classes) are available as well!

I went to that site, and indeed found a 120 page book in English for the
Introduction to Sociology Course, and many other courses had both
textbooks and PowerPoint slides. I was thinking about extracting all
these links, and inserting them into my
[index](http://reganmian.net/vu), however the interface does not offer
any simple way of extracting all the links.

[![](http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/cssforum.png "cssforum")](http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/cssforum.png)The
above postings are from the site CSSForum: Civil Service of Pakistan, a
very active forum where users help each other prepare for the civil
service exams. They have forums for all the obligatory subjects, and in
the [sociology
section](http://www.cssforum.com.pk/css-optional-subjects/group-b/sociology/)
you can find interesting posts like [Great Muslim Scientists and their
Contributions to the Field of
Sociology](http://www.cssforum.com.pk/css-compulsory-subjects/everyday-science/29544-great-muslim-scientists-their-contributions-field-science.html),
[discussion of Marxist theory of
labor](http://www.cssforum.com.pk/css-optional-subjects/group-b/sociology/29825-karl-marx-labour-theory-help.html),
or [a question about the contributions of Ibn-e-Khaldun to the field of
sociology](http://www.cssforum.com.pk/css-optional-subjects/group-b/sociology/30426-contributions-ibn-e-khaldun.html).
I found it very interesting how the students were actively helping each
other prepare for these different exams, and selflessly sharing
resources and experiences.

also found it very interesting to see past exam papers, for example [the
2010 bilingual exam on Islamic
issues](http://www.cssforum.com.pk/css-past-papers/css-2010-past-papers/31904-islamiat-paper-2010-a.html).
Students have to give written answers to questions such as "Keeping in
view today's International Political System, can Shariah be adjusted in
the Islamic Societies", and "Keeping in view the requirements of Global
Society, determine the freedom and limitations of a Muslim Woman in the
light of Islamic teachings". It would be very interesting to see samples
of how the future government bureaucrats of Pakistan answered these
questions! There is also a section called "[Everyday
Science](http://www.cssforum.com.pk/css-past-papers/css-2010-past-papers/31866-every-day-science-paper-2010-a.html)",
which is wonderfully eclectic. Here is a small selection:

> **Question \# 02 :** Write short note on the following by giving their
> exact life span and contributions to the field of science. ( Accurate
> fact will be appreciated) (10)
>
> ​a) Al- Beruni b) Ibn- al - Haitham

I wonder how the average American civil servant would have done on this
exam.

I think formal and informal OER can have a huge positive impact on
international understanding, and to me, this is a prime example of what
Mike Caulfield called [OER as
transparency.](http://mikecaulfield.com/2009/01/25/openness-as-reuse-and-openness-as-transparency/)

Not one to normally promote Microsoft or the Zune, I came across [this
site](http://www.zune-arts.net) with beautiful short films created by
various artists, and wanted to share them. They are very much worth
watching. I realize this is just what Microsoft wanted to achieve -
viral spread - but hey, if they promote cool artists, I am all for it,
and I trust you are all adult enough to make your own decisions about
whether to buy a Zune or not!

I particularly liked these:

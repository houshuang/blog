I gave a presentation at [OISE Education
Commons](http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/ec) today, together with [Professor
Jim
Slotta](http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/depts/ctl/facultystaff/profiles/profile.php?lastname=Slotta&firstname=James),
entitled ["Open education around the
world"](http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/ec/workshops/Special_Events/index.html#slotta_haklev_opened).
I was very grateful to be invited by Education Commons to give one of
their talk, since they only feature one or two each semester. I was also
very lucky to be working together with Jim, because our pre-talk
meetings really helped me focus and sharpen my thinking around OER.

As usual, I will try to share this talk as widely as possible. The
slides are [available on
SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/houshuang/open-education-around-the-world)
(and can be
[downloaded](http://www.slideshare.net/houshuang/open-education-around-the-world/download)
from there), [a video of the talk synchronized with the
slides](http://142.150.98.64/OISE/20090312-100421-1/rnh.htm) has been
put up, and there will even be a podcast, thanks to [some
people](http://podcasts.ischool.utoronto.ca/) at the [Toronto
iSchool](http://www.ischool.utoronto.ca/). I will update this post as
more material becomes available.

This post is mainly to share a number of resources that I went through
in my talk, so that people who watched it in person, or online, and
found something in particular interesting, can go and check out that
resource.

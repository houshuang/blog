Just doing research for a short paper on brain drain. The statistics I
am coming over are quite incredible. For example, there are more
Ethiopian doctors in Chicago alone, than in all of Ethiopia! And of the
700 doctors that were educated in Zambia after independence, only about
60 are left. 80% of all the doctors in Saskatchewan are educated outside
of Canada, and the US yearly imports as many doctors as they educate -
saving as much money as they give in development aidâ€¦

(I realize I should have linked all to sources, but I have an essay due.
Ask me.)

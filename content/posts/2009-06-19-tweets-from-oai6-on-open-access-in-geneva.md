So my European travels are drawing towards an end. Lot's of new
impressions to digest, both from the travel, and from [ElPub
2009](http://conferences.aepic.it/elpub2009/) and
[OAI6](http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=48321)which I
attended. Tomorrow morning I will try to catch a few hours of
[HackMeeting](http://it.hackmeeting.org/index.php?lang=en) in Milan,
before I fly back to Beijing, spending a few days in Dubai on the way.

I will try to post more about my experiences, but in the meantime I am
posting my [tweets](http://twitter.com/houshuang) from OAI6 as an
experiment. Not sure if seeing them like this gives any value, but I
thought I'd give it a try. (I simply searched twitter for "[\#oai6
from:houshuang](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23oai6+from%3Ahoushuang)",
copied it to TextMate, and used a few regexps to clean it up. I then put
it in a spreadsheet, to reverse the order so the oldest tweets come
first.

-   In Zurich with friend. Geneva and \#oai6 on Wednesday. Then Milan
  and a day of \#hackmeeting, \#dubai, and back to \#beijing
-   In Geneva, great time with awesome \#couchsurfing host. \#oai6
  tomorrow.
-   \#oai6 Discussion about whether/why institutional repositories
  should be aiming for 100% coverage of publications in tut 2.
-   \#oai6 CERN harvests publications by own researchers from 90
  repositories, makes up 50% of repository. Total coverage rate 80%.
  (tut2)
-   Thinking abt workshop, interactivity... "open exercises" where
  facilitator knows exactly what she is looking for. Opp. to
  open-ended. \#oai6
-   @icutler Another Norwegian at \#oai6? Greetings. Hope to run into
  you non-virtually as well.
-   Herbert Van de Sompel gave amazingly inspiring intro talk - great
  opening to the conference that has me fired up. Lot's to think abt.
  \#oai6
-   How long until universities go from specifying font sizes and
  margins of PhD theses, to specifying which dtd to use? \#oai6
-   With all this new XML, semantic data, etc - where do IRs come in?
  Which either take pre-prints (.doc/.pdf) or publishers pdf? \#oai6
-   Any IRs that are requesting publishers XML files, as opposed to
  PDFs? \#oai6
-   \#oai6 Interesting talk, but I just listened to it verbatim fiv
  (\#elpub09). (Houghton)
-   @iamtimmo It was an amazing morning session that really has my
  inspired and my neurons buzzing. Congrats! \#oai6
-   Back from a great alcohol-sharing meet hosted at CERN \#oai6.
  Location didn't add 2 much, but met some great peeps. Look frwrd 2
  reconn 2mrw
-   Nature Publishing Group to begin allowing academic text mining of
  their articles. Interesting to see what ppl will come up with.
  \#oai6
-   NPG launching Nature Communications, publishing from April next year
  - "new paradigm", authors choose subscription or OA, deriv or no.
  \#oai6
-   I still need to think abt this more deeply... "when will
  repositories ask for publishers' XMLs, rather than PDFs"? Inspired
  by portico \#oai6
-   \#oai6 Breakout group on future of scientific communication: one of
  the most intelligent, polite and pleasant exchanges I've
  participated in.
-   \#oai6 All conferenced out, went for some pad thai and a Swedish
  movie with German/French subtitles. Nice with a complete change ;)
-   \#oai6 Thomson Reuters presentation on ResearcherID. This is sorely
  needed - let's see if their solution is the best.
-   \#oai6 ResearcherID... this is really needed, not convinced Thomson
  are the right people. It'll be messy until the dust settles.
-   RT @epoz: MESUR Project. In a league of its own. Have seen pres. on
  it before, but I am still blown away. \#oai6 (I agree!)
-   RT @azaroth42: http://www.mesur.org/services/ MESUR services site
  \#oai6
-   Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics: open peer review can still be
  anonymous. Good point. I think OA is more important than ID. \#oai6
-   \#oai6 Poster prize to be announced. Tension rises
-   \#oai6 E-LIS won best poster... Very unclear about how one evaluates
  posters, but E-LIS is a great project so kudos to them!
-   \#oai6 That's that for this year. Tons of new ideas and thoughts.
  See you all in two years (or sooner)! Arrivederci.
-   RT @frumiousMimsy: overheard coming from some U of Geneva students
  walking by the posters at \#oai6 : "this is for really intelligent
  people"

I was lucky enough to be invited to give a talk at Indian Institute of
Public Administration in New Delhi, a research institute that does
consulting jobs for the Indian government and also training of senior
civil servants. I spoke to a group of perhaps 25 librarians and
professors, trying to give a “whirlwind” tour of the field of open
research and open learning, both in general but also in terms of its
usefulness for developing countries. It seemed to be well received, and
I had several requests afterward for more information. I recorded the
lecture on Audacity on my MacBook (quality is mostly good, except for a
few times when I turn away from my laptop), and synched it with the
slides on SlideShare (synch is mostly good except when the slides change
too fast, and SlideShare can’t keep up).

Feel free to have a look and let me know what you think. Below I have
also included all the links from the presentation, mainly for the
benefit of those who attended.

Thanks again to IIPA and Dr. Munshi for inviting me.

***Correction: Hindawi is based in Egypt, not in India. Apologies for
this. However, there is still a lot of open access journals being
published in India.***

***Update: Here is a [direct link to the MP3
recording](http://reganmian.net/IIPA%20Presentation.mp3) (if you press
play below, it will play the sound and sync the slides, but if you have
a slow connection, or want to listen offline).***

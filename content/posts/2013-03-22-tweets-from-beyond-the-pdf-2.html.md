I had an amazing time at [Beyond the PDF
2](http://www.force11.org/beyondthepdf2) in Amsterdam (March 19-20). I
met so many of the people whose blogs I've been following, did a demo of
[my open academic workflow](http://reganmian.net/wiki/researchr:start),
gave a 3 minute pitch for ["Why we need an open alternative to Google
Scholar"](http://www.slideshare.net/houshuang/stian-haklev-vision), for
which I won a shared second place, and came back filled with ideas and
connections. I hope to write a series of blog posts highlighting some of
the things I saw and heard at the conference, but I thought I'd start by
posting an archive of my tweets.

I've done this a few times before, from [Critical Point of
View](http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/01/14/tweets-from-critical-point-of-view-wikiwars-conference-in-bangalore/)
in Bangalore, [Learning Analytics
Conference](http://reganmian.net/blog/2011/03/04/tweets-from-learning-analytics-conference-2011/) ([and
pre-conference](http://reganmian.net/blog/2011/02/27/notes-from-learning-analytics-conference-2011-pre-conference/))
in Banff, and
[OAI6](http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/06/19/tweets-from-oai6-on-open-access-in-geneva/)
in Geneva, and even created [a
tutorial](http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/04/12/manipulating-list-of-tweets-with-textmate-with-screencast-2/)
on how to generate this list using TextMate. This time, I grabbed the
archive from [Bodong](http://bodongchen.com/)'s [Twitter analytics
app](http://t.co/n4RgyaBfwF), and used R to select only my tweets. I
cleaned them up a bit, removed some purely housekeeping ones, and added
a bunch of links for context.

This archive will also be useful for myself in reminding me what we
talked about, things to follow up on, etc.

Before the conference
---

-   Amsterdam beer and talking semantic publications with @pixievondust
  and @jschneider, great opening to
  [\#btpdf2](http://www.force11.org/beyondthepdf2)! Looking forward
  till tmrw

Day 1

### Before lunch

-   RT @kaythaney: .@pgroth kicks off with a challenge: [what would you
  do with \$1K today to make research communication
  better](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bllDGpoYGWUKEmiKjOv36XedITaWUBLS0PYsPjS9QCM/edit)
  (note ...
-   Twitter ecosystem slowly being suffocated, and I find myself using
  it less and less, but for conferences still where it's at.
-   Kathleen Fitzpatrick opening. [Notes from her talk "Peer-to-Peer
  Review and Networked Scholarly
  Communication"](http://reganmian.net/wiki/peer-to-peer_review_and_networked_scholarly_communication)
-   @jeroenbosman Are any of these really suited for today? Why so much
  focus on italics etc when we can use URLs, DOIs etc? (genuine q)
-   Fitzpatrick's mom when publishers couldn't publish her monograph
  bec. of commercial concerns. "They were expecting to make money?"
-   "You could just publish your entire monograph online, with reviewer
  comments - but I know that's not realistic"... @kfitz: "Why not?"
-   Anyone researching the future of scholarly meetings? Been to some
  innovative confs, but would love to see research, documentation
-   "learning at conferences" should be a field of study (want 2 see
  learning scientists use learning theories to rsrch rsrch)
-   @rmounce Remember that "theoretically" many may read the monograph
  at a library. Many journals with only 400 subscribers too.
-   @petermurrayrust What's your definition of citizen hackers?
-   [Give grad students researching in other countries grants to help
  translate
  thesis](http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/03/07/a-fair-trade-logo-for-academic-research/)
  \#1k
-   Re 400 monographs sold, [my MA thesis was downloaded 1600
  times](http://reganmian.net/blog/2012/02/08/results-of-a-1-5-year-academic-publishing-experiment/),
  so I guess I'm doing OK :)
-   Would be great if you could do some [data viz/analysis of
  tweets](http://bodongchen.com/blog/?p=290), @bodongchen like
-   \#MOOCs and - [Indig
  Educ@OISE](https://class.coursera.org/aboriginaled-001/class/index)
  - 22,000 students using OA papers in their learning. Powerful
  argument for \#OA
-   @rubp Cool, would love to come. I've also been playing with [open
  scholarly workflow - lit review
  etc](http://reganmian.net/wiki/researchr:start)
-   Wish name tags were bigger - know so many people here but not
  faces...
-   .@edsu Giving a vision talk ["Why we need an open alternative to
  Google
  Scholar"](http://www.slideshare.net/houshuang/stian-haklev-vision)
  tomorrow. Happy to discuss!
-   .@AubreyMcFato @edsu @doajplus Yeah, one of a number of projects
  that it would be great to build on - so much unexplored potential
-   @edsu Journals should ping a server w/bib\* metadata, like blogs.
  Standardized micro data. Importing existing databases. CommonCrawl
-   Love idea of reproducible research, see these cool showcases of
  [IPYnbs](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks)
  and [R+knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/showcase/)
-   .@jschneider @aubreymcfato @edsu @doajplus Breakout on
  OpenScholarSearch - let's make it happen, when/where?
-   Compare diff aka search sites w my name
  [BASE](http://www.base-search.net/Search/Results?lookfor=stian+haklev&type=all&ling=1&name=&thes=&refid=dcresen&newressearch=1),
  [GScholar](http://scholar.google.nl/scholar?hl=en&q=stian+haklev),
  [MS Academic
  Search](http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Search?query=stian%20haklev).
  GScholar wins...
-   Wrote up a bunch of unfinished detailed ideas for [a social reading
  hub](http://reganmian.net/wiki/ideas_for_scrobblr), much applies to
  \#OpenScholarSearch
-   @neuro\_cloud Not sure if Reddit is the best tool for this, but
  doesn't hurt to try.
-   Funny disembodied conference, saw two old friends tweeting with,
  excited to meet them in person - both are not here :)
-   For people who see \#RDALaunch hashtag and want to know what it's
  about, [more
  info](http://www.eudat.eu/events/rda-launch-and-first-plenary)
-   @axfelix There will be a lot of new innovation in RSS readers in the
  next 6 months... Is GSch similarly stifling innovation? \#goodenuf
-   @Protohedgehog They also [funded 33 students to attend, pretty
  amazing. Let them try to keep up as we try to out-innovate them.
  :)](http://www.force11.org/sponsors)
-   .@axfelix GScholar has no API, [and there will not be
  one](https://t.co/ShW4d11GqX) - pretty crucial.
-   @axfelix Is that an argument for or against? I also want to interact
  with aka search, don't have lot's of ppl to de-engineer...
-   @axfelix I think (hope) there are ppl attending who do believe in
  overthrowing global capitalism (or GSch)... we can build sth better!
-   @Dreusicke I like being able to download data and display/process
  how I want. Only on the web like DRM - could disappear tomorrow.
-   Backchannel has been great, but I'm worried that it will fade after
  lunch as everyone start running out of juice... \#no-power-plugs
-   @axfelix Makes me think of all the congratulatory tech news stories
  about use of Linux in China. Reality is almost Win-monoculture
-   @juancommander glob south, I'd love to see issue of language raised
  as well, maybe more central to socsci/humanities than hard sci?
-   @axfelix I think bandwidth and lack of ubiquitous/always-on access
  is much bigger problem (and maybe access to devices/mobile)

### After lunch

-   [Journal of open research
  software](http://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/) sounds great.
-   [Online journals and faster horses](http://t.co/2QDOv9cZ90)

  papers that get rejected just in WoS..that's around 1000 years ...
-   Kaveh on copy editing "we read it many times so you only need to
  read it once"
-   Kaveh: one very complex page of journal w math can take 2000 lines
  of XML
-   RT @rmounce: The blog post should be the 'Version of Record'. Dump
  XML, make HTML-5 the base VoR standard @kaveh1000
-   Interesting point by Murray Rust regarding the need for typesetters,
  with good incentives, people can do it themselves
-   [This panel is highlight so far, so many neat projects! How can
  people get involved,
  contribute?](http://www.force11.org/Dissemination)
-   I'll be graduating in 2 years and looking for a job. A job board for
  people who care abt sci2.0 and openness?
-   Funny w where presenters can't do live demos, presenter suggests
  beyond the PowerPoint conference ;)
-   @juancommander how about independent open access journals w no
  budgets?
-   @juancommander many journals say they'll waive them for those who
  can't pay. Not sure how works in practice
-   @rmounce we're doing [institutional research on that at
  utoronto](http://open.utoronto.ca). And I think many other
  institutions are as well
-   \#Peter Murray Rust talks about the "scholarly poor" - non
  academics, SMEs, etc. Making the case for research funding.
-   @kelli\_barr not just access to Western rsrch, when doing rsrch on
  Indo libr, easier to find Western than loc rsrch, not digital
-   @kaythaney @neuro\_cloud which includes language
-   RT @kaythaney: I love that "we all *know* we're moving towards Open
  Access" is an understood, throwaway comment in this crowd. \#oa
-   Anyone going out for beer and more food after this? Or everyone
  jetlagged and tired? :)

Day 2

### Before lunch

-   Academics reading almost twice as many articles per year as in 1977.
  Huge increase with e-access, beginning to level off. [Tenopir
  (](http://scholar.cci.utk.edu/carol-tenopir/home)[report](https://www.jisc-collections.ac.uk/Reports/ukscholarlyreadingreport/))
-   RT @anitawaard: 80% increase in nr of article readings; 30 %
  descrease in time per article read - unsustainable trend! Tenopir
-   I must've shown [my scholarly
  wiki](http://reganmian.net/wiki/researchr:start) to a lot of people
  yesterday, given how many pages I had to remove this AM
-   Insightful, how do we address this? RT @mfenner [The Price of
  Innovation - my Thoughts for Beyond the

-   RT @petermurrayrust: Almost no mention of \#scholarlypoor - OUTSIDE
  academia. Usually called "consumers". T ...
-   RT @petermurrayrust:. Anyone present want to challenge the system
  and create a bottom up OPEN infrastructure for \#scholarly comm ...
-   Excited about "Making it happen" session - although shouldn't that
  be the two day conference, rather than 1.5 h? :)
-   @jschneider @tac\_niso Also wonder about other submission formats -
  anyone accept papers in Markdown?
-   Haven't talked much about authoring tools/workflows here. Anyone
  excited about [scholarly
  Markdown?](http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2012/12/13/a-call-for-scholarly-markdown/)
  @mfenner
-   Wish we had more time for breakout sessions (more sessions). Several
  things I want to talk to people about
-   Reuse of scholarly slides at \#btpdf2, very cutting edge :)
-   RT @CameronNeylon: I want to lock all the developer groups in a room
  until we agree a path to an interoperating ecosystem. Then ...
-   @CameronNeylon Is there an empirical study of how often locking
  people in rooms lead to solutions? It seems like a common idea! :)
-   [3 min vision talks](http://www.force11.org/program#Vision) are the
  last session today. Maybe it should be the first, so we could spend
  day planning/implementing? \#btpdf3
-   @CameronNeylon So we just need 500 people to tweet with \#1k
  hashtag. \#we-can-do-it
-   @kerim @ilya @mfenner [@criticmarkup](http://criticmarkup.com/) Very
  neat, how can we push this forward? I'd like to be involved.
  \#lets-make-it-happen
-   @InfoFuturesNYU @datadryad Eating dogfood, brilliant. Data about
  data sharing by scientists, openly available.
-   Hackfest to create tools/workflows/documentation on using Scholarly
  Markdown+Git for academic authoring/collab \#1k @CameronNeylon
-   @TAC\_NISO @ianmulvany @cameronneylon And all ideas look more
  brilliant when sketched on napkins! Need napkin.js
  [\#coffe-stain.js](https://github.com/levskaya/coffeestain/blob/master/coffeestain.html)

  [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) and @fperez\_org from [IPython
  Notebook](http://ipython.org/) at this conf, executable
  docs-\>beyond PDF
-   Graeme Hirst: Post-modernists are high-verbiage, zero logic. Vs
  people who only talk in LaTeX-math mode. Great talk! @graemehirst
-   @petermurrayrust @okfn Would have loved to join [OKFN
  conf/hackfest](http://blog.okfn.org/2013/03/21/announcing-the-open-knowledge-conference-2013-open-data-broad-deep-connected/).
  Always tricky to get funding. (I'm ironically here because of
  Elsevier)
-   RT @petermurrayrust: We shouldn't spend so much time talking, we
  should be doing and creating
-   @pgroth @petermurrayrust People travel across the world anyway, have
  an extra day of "doing"... just need a location with wifi+power
-   RT @anitawaard: .@erwinverb [Tools](http://www.force11.org/tools)

  rdr](http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/) in my workflow-love
  highlight, export clips, and AppleScript support.
-   Five min flash talks - nice warm up for 3 min vision talks later
  today. Great with pitches, call for action
-   [@anitawaard](http://www.slideshare.net/anitawaard)\` is amazing
  like always - great example of how lab research is actually
  documented in US labs
-   RT @jschneider Sensemaking involves collage-based manipulation of
  electronic, born-digital materials, printed and annotated on paper.
  @anitadewaard
-   Graft tools closely on scientists' daily practice. (Why
  "anthropological studies" of researchers important,
  [Tenopir](https://www.jisc-collections.ac.uk/Reports/ukscholarlyreadingreport/)
  etc) @anitawaard
-   Love the X-Files theme when speakers go over their time

-   RT @researchremix: \#1k A YC/techstars incubator for scholarly
  communication startups. Mentorship, leg up in biz, marketing, fun

-   @researchremix Does it also require more work on funding models? Can
  we pitch VCs on funding projects with open source/OA etc?
-   [PKP XML](http://pkp.sfu.ca/lemon8) tool looks awesome, was shocked
  when I first realised OJS didn't have document pipeline, very happy
  to see this! @axfelix
-   Out of the box NLM-compatible styles is huge, the PKP doing this is
  huge.
-   @phillord You can generate HTML, PDF etc from NLM XML. Semantic vs
  presentation format.
-   Great that @rmounce is [talking about PDF
  metadata](http://rossmounce.co.uk/2012/12/31/pdf-metadata-why-so-poor/),
  I've been frustrated over this for a long time! Let's go for
  \#low-hanging fruit!
-   Everyone should read this: [Why can't I manage academic papers like
  MP3s?](http://repository.cmu.edu/isr/494/) \#pdfmetadata
-   Yes, I want publications tagged with whether they are OA, license...
  Only on the web, but after I downloaded, how do I know? \#rmounce
-   talk on \#[ORCID](http://orcid.org), excited about potential,
  looking forward to seeing them more in the wild
-   "There is no problem if you just give me more money and use my tool"
  ... so true :)
-   @pixievondust What does use constitute? I have one, and I'd love to
  tag my pubs etc, but not sure of journals who support that etc.

  but difficult to publish them, \#should-be-working-on-my-phd
-   @ianmulvany PS: loved [blog post about

  includes \#OA, and translation

### After lunch

-   @mfenner wish it was more extensible
  ([Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/)), I'd like the
  citations to have links to my wiki - plugins, filters without
  learning Haskell

-   @mfenner it's hard to be subtle in 3 mins but I'm actually all abt
  coordination as opposed to reinvention
-   @mfenner again, let's do it. I can't do even a fraction by myself,
  eager to contribute to projects that can.
-   @phillord my ideal is citations just list of unique identifiers.
  User/app can render any way they want.
-   @lukask @phillord any journal accepting markdown+btex file?
  publishing these alongside HTML etc? Maybe modify [Jekyll for jrnl
  only](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
-   @mfenner @lukask @phillord happy to. Know of any
  [bibjson](http://www.bibjson.org/) ruby libraries? otherwise we
  should make it
-   @axfelix does it accept markdown as well? Is this released in
  [OJS](http://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/) or when coming? Sounds awesome and
  overdue \#ojs
-   \#Kaveh: publishers, give us XML. Yes! Publishers: format is not
  your business. Want to read in my house style. Yes!
-   \#ah the perils of live demos on others' computers, very brave!
-   \#very impressive by Kaveh! Why we need d/l-able files, control to
  readers not platforms.

-   Publishers whatever, how can I get my PhD thesis into XLM w/I ppl in

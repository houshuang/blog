I have been thinking for a while about wanting to post more quick links,
without having to write long articles, when I want to share articles I
have read, or sites I have come across. Perhaps something like what
[Kottke](http://www.kottke.org) does with his tiny links. Perhaps I
could also integrate my Google Reader shared links somehow - but not all
of my readings come through Google Reader. Either way, for now, here is
an interesting paper about [Chinese studentsâ€™ experiences in US graduate
school](http://jps.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/hep/article/viewFile/658/716)
by the (unfortunately seemingly defunct) [Higher Education
Perspectives](http://jps.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/hep/).

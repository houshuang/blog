I am just back from Bangalore, where I had the good fortune to
participate in the [Critical Point of View: WikiWars
conference](http://www.cis-india.org/news/wikiwars) - a critical
reflection on Wikipedia from a number of point of views. I will probably
write more about some of the most interesting presentations, my own
presentation, and other thoughts, but I thought I'd start by posting my
tweets.

It varies how much I tweet from conferences (or in general), but during
this conference, I found myself using Twitter quite frequently. It
serves as both a note taking function, a way to communicate with some of
the others in the room, a way to focus on the content of the talk
(rather than letting thoughts wander), and a conduit for people who are
not participating.

I am not sure how useful this collection of Tweets are for people who
were not present, but I am posting them here as a collection.
[Earlier](http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/06/19/tweets-from-oai6-on-open-access-in-geneva/)
I posted the tweets from the OAI6 conference, and also mentioned how I
created the list.

Here they are, all 130 of them:

-   In Bangalore at Centre for Internet and Society for \#wikiwars
  conference. Bangalore seems nice, a small-town busy feel.
-   Just back from Avatar - good movie, but all the criticisms about the
  noble savage etc are right on. Looking forward to \#wikiwars tmrw.
-   @StevenWalling That's kind of nice - new voices. I love Doctorow and
  Lessig, but we've all heard from them before. \#wikiwars
-   \#wikiwars 3d wiki art installation - open space idea. First
  discussion starting: Wikipedia theory.
-   \#wikiwars "WP has gotten big enough that it deserves a research
  conference that is entirely external to WikiMedia Foundation."
-   Using new Google Live Search to follow \#wikiwars updates in
  real-time (automatically updating) http://bit.ly/8Cvc1i (expand)
-   Challenge @ \#wikiwars: since we've all circulated 2k word
  abstracts, how to structure 15 min presentation to still be engaging
  to everyone?
-   @ilya Cool, I'm very interested in Wikipedias in Indic languages.
  \#wikiwars
-   \#wikiwars Stuart Geiger presenting on bots in WP governance. I find
  his work very interesting.
-   \#wikiwars Wisdom of crowds vs wisdom of bots?
-   WP works bec. vandals outnumbered by good users? NO - 500-100 ppl
  banned every day! \#wikiwars
-   @tinucherian Cool! Random spot check: "Norway" 2 paras, but
  "Democracy" and "Physics" both good length. :) (Can't check quality)
  \#wikiwars
-   \#wikiwars @tinucherian Quick tool for checking articles in other
  languages http://bit.ly/7KmqJN (expand). Used it to check ML article
  length.
-   \#wikiwars Geiger: bots help reinstitute traditional features of the
  old style of production (gatekeepers, quality control, authority)
-   \#wikiwars Geiger: bot "nominated itself" for adminship - very
  convincing :) the machines are taking over! :)
-   \#wikiwars: Geiger: Are academics given epistemic roles in addition
  to academic. Do academics need to know coding to make headway in WP?
-   \#wikiwars Automatically redirect to the longest article in any of
  the official languages in India: http://pastebin.com/f5a21b4db
-   @wirefire Yes, but is there any difference between stylistic choices
  in WP and other trad encyclopedias? \#wikiwars
-   \#wikiwars Comment from audience: presentations give idea that
  Wikipedia is 1984'ish alienating modern nightmare...
-   \#wikiwars Geiger: Some of my best friends are bots. Pseudonymity is
  not equal to anonymity!
-   "Do we need to know who has written something to be able to trust
  it? Or do we want to know who is it when we DON'T trust sb?"
  \#wikiwars
-   \#wikiwars Wonder what the usage of bots is in other language
  versions (non-English)... Are there active bots on HI WP, ML WP?
-   RT @thewikipedian: More @staeiou gems: I"f Wikipedia is a
  battleground, the footnotes [citations] are the bullets." \#wikiwars
-   \#wikiwars Dror: Syrians much more sensitive abt what is in Arabic
  Wikipedia, than English. I think the Chinese feel the same abt ZH
  WP.
-   @williambeutler (Abt Nandi and French quote). I'm all for that.
  Maybe I'll give my entire prez tomorrow in Indonesian. \#wikiwars
-   Lot's of interesting epistemological discussions at \#wikiwars, is
  there objective knowledge? is NPOV possible? 很有意思的认识论的讨论
  - 中立的知识存在吗?
-   @gkjohn 5:30 I think. There's a dinner at 7:30, maybe you could
  sneak in :) \#wikiwars
-   \#wikiwars Dror: Wikipedia exposed me to new ideas/facts that I
  didn't hear in "politically correct" school.
-   \#wikiwars Dror: It *is* possible to get near objective knowledge,
  and it's needed in conflict topics, we shouldn't just give up!
-   \#wikiwars Question: What would you do if WP wasn't there? Answer:
  It *wasn't* there...
-   Dror: When learning Arabic, talking to A-speakers, amazed how
  different our knowledge was. Excited by WP - this is what we needed!
  \#wikiwars
-   \#wikiwars Internet as a distributed network, and Wikipedia as *one*
  place.
-   \#wikiwars Are articles about Pokemon frivolous/don't matter? Should
  this disqualify from adminship?
-   \#wikiwars Dror: Difference between writing *about* a narrative, and
  adopting it. We can and should do the first, and not the second.
-   \#wikiwars Dror: East and West cult. difference of neutrality and
  objectivity? When working w/ Arab editors, noticed difference in
  standards.
-   \#wikiwars Dror: Do we not only need different language versions,
  but also WPs written from different epistemic traditions?
-   @cormaggio you would have been an obvius guest. although exclusively
  wp, not all wmf projs. \#wikiwars
-   \#wikiwars very excited abt \#hfordsa talk. disillusioned, next 8
  yrs to work out what went wrong. want more impact in dev'l countries
-   \#wikiwars cc as political artefact, and what are the other options?
-   \#wikiwars lessig: ways of regulating: market, law, norms,
  artefacts. which work better where?
-   \#wikiwars no more laptop batt, using ipod. i suck at typing fast
-   \#wikiwars sunil and hfordsa are both disillusioned/critical of open
  movenents. hm, what are alternatives? how do we move forward?
-   \#wikiwars hfordsa: by choosing cc we're reinforcing copyright,
  commodification of culture...?
-   @ilya I've made a list for \#WikiWars. See
  http://twitter.com/jackerhack/wikiwars. (via @jackerhack)
-   \#wikiwars @hfordsa sth i wrote earlier related to encouraging
  sharing w/o bogged down w/ law http://bit.ly/71lFdi (expand)
-   \#wikiwars A very interesting first day is over. A lot of criticism
  about openness, licenses. The idea of an objective truth.
-   \#wikiwars Quite a few things that I will pick up in my presentation
  tomorrow. Great with so much time for debate and questions!
-   I dreamt I was invited to give a presentation about open licenses
  and OER to a primary school assembly. Weird. \#wikiwars
-   \#wikiwars Ready for day two of WikiWars. Today - with power! :) May
  the games begin.
-   \#wikiwars "It's scary that we all agree that we need to be critical
  to Wikipedia?" Being critical doesn't mean being negative...
-   RT @thewikipedian: I've heard of "greenwashing" and recently,
  "localwashing", but @sunil\_abraham offers a new one: "openwashing"
  \#wikiwars
-   \#wikiwars @sunil\_abraham: You kill local/traditional knowledge by
  encoding it?
-   \#wikiwars Sunil: Apparently Bangalore hasn't changed name to
  Bengaluuru yet, lost in bureaucracy and politics. Surprising.
-   \#wikiwars Dror: Is there a consensus in this panel that Wikipedia
  is *not* a revolution?
-   \#wikiwars Geert: WP is traditional in its understand of what
  knowledge is. Very biased towards Western idea. Epistemological and
  geographic.
-   \#wikiwars I don't see the geographical divide as critical. It can
  be solved by added more articles - rather than fundamentally
  changing.
-   \#wikiwars Stuart: Revolution is an empty signifier.
-   \#wikiwars "Trying to defend wiki part by clinging to the pedia
  part."
-   RT @hfordsa: 'Wikipedia might be revolutionary but not in the way
  that Wikipedia defines itself' NishantShah \#wikiwars
-   @fuzheado You guys should do a Wikipedia Weekly episode on the
  \#WikiWars conference going on in Bangalore. Lot's of interesting
  discussions.
-   \#wikiwars Apparently Indian teachers want handwritten instead of
  printed, to avoid copy+paste. Interesting.
-   RT @wirefire: http://bit.ly/71BHKK (expand) -- how often does Indian
  law refer to wikipedia? Shocking revelations \#wikiwars
-   Sad how many people could not make it to \#wikiwars. But still a
  great crowd.
-   \#wikiwars @williambeutler Starts presentation about why people
  join/leave WP, and what to do about it. Doors and windows. Or sth.
-   \#wikiwars Bill: Who reads WP? Most people. But very low WP literacy
  - how does project work, talk pages, warning tags, etc.
-   \#wikiwars Bill: Hard to how many contribute to WP. Most edits by
  small amnt of ppl, but if those are only tiny changes, does it mean
  anyth?
-   \#wikiwars Bill: Look at a few articles - most edit counts, made
  smallest contrib. Biggest contrib by accts that did not have many
  edits.
-   \#wikiwars Bill: more reasons to leave WP than to stay there.
-   \#wikiwars Bill: 50 policies, 150+ site guidelines, advisory essays.
  WP is *complicated*. (ENWP, what about other langs? Less
  bureaucracy?)
-   \#wikiwars Bill: Some people who leave Wikipedia leave "suicide
  notes".
-   \#wikiwars Any good working tools to animate WP edit history? Most
  tools here http://waxy.org/2005/06/automating\_wiki/ broken links.
-   \#wikiwars Ilya: Re-appropriating WP, lazy people's archive? LAM
  sector in Taiwan.
-   \#wikiwars My bad, Ilya is not about LAM sector in Taiwan. That's
  another guy.
-   @zimmee Was just repeating speaker's word. But it's an interesting
  concept to let an "online persona" "die"... \#wikiwars
-   \#wikiwars Great to finally have sb talk about other language WPs...
  (One earlier also studied German WP).
-   \#wikiwars Ilya: Story of zh-min-nan Wikipedia.
-   \#wikiwars Ilya: What is "Chinese"? ISO code only given for
  Mandarin, written language. How to write Taiwanese w/o characters?
  Holopedia...
-   \#wikiwars Ilya: Purchased Holopedia.org, installed Mediawiki (OSS),
  couldn't update software easily, couldn't connect to other langs in
  WP.
-   \#wikiwars Ilya: Interesting - early paper-drawn prototype of
  Holopedia, zh-minnan WP.
-   \#wikiwars Ilya: Decide to use certain transcription/writing system
  (dev'l by missionaries). Apply to WP again, accepted in 2004/2005.
-   \#wikiwars Ilya: Pan-Chineselization vs indep. langs. Relation with
  Taiwanese independence movement? Reductionism. Cultural
  revitalization.
-   \#wikiwars Input method is not method, web browser not just tool,
  localization get you globalized, fonts should be better than its
  terms (?)
-   \#wikiwars Ilya: a number of Chinese dialect WPs emerge.
-   \#wikiwars Ilya: Toward FormosanPedia... Me: But WPs are supposed to
  be by language, not by territory?
-   \#wikiwars Tsou: Why Taiwan doesn't like WP? New presentation
  starting.
-   \#wikiwars Tsou: We all use WP academically, but we are required to
  "remove all traces".
-   \#wikiwars Tsou: Strawberry generation in TW ("we don't all look
  like this"). Born after 1981, self-indulgent, credit cards,
  disobedient.
-   \#wikiwars Tsou: My teachers used to beat me often, for me it was
  natural. Now they record on handcamera, and upload online.
-   \#wikiwars Tsou: Current generation didn't go through proper
  brainwashing process, lack committment!
-   \#wikiwars Tsou: Brought up in greenhouse environment. Beautiful,
  fragile. High maintenance. Low frustration tolerance.
-   \#wikiwars Tsou: When growing up, only taught mainland hist. and
  geo. We called ourselves "Chinese". Now different. Nat'l identity
  contested.
-   RT @MadanRao: "Strawberry generation": - I always love these
  cultural metaphors! Wonder what fruits apply to other cultures?
  \#WikiWars
-   \#wikiwars Tsou: All turning into 穷忙族, poor while being busy,
  busily being poor.
-   \#wikiwars Tsou: They actually have a Chinese language
  "Uncyclopedia"! Neat! Kuso - means "shit" or poor quality in
  Japanese.
-   \#wikiwars Tsou: lovetaiwan.jpg Picture of a Chinese character
  shaped as swastika - resistance toward pervasive concept of
  patriotism?
-   \#wikiwars Tsou: Our encyclopedia is "contaminated" by Chinese
  Uncyclopedia - people write vulgar things, and it isn't
  revised/removed.
-   \#wikiwars Presentation is over. I love these international
  perspectives. So many rich local cultures represented! Now panel
  discussion.
-   \#wikiwars Audience: What have you meant by resistance? Resistance
  to what? Nishant: Read our website :)
-   \#wikiwars Maybe Wikipedia needs an "exit interview" to find out why
  people leave. Sometimes intentional, sometimes just fades away?
-   \#wikiwars Dror: Countries with more leisure culture contribute
  more?
-   \#wikiwars Tsou: Our education system doesn't encourage us to do
  anything outside of the "rules". That's why "uncyclopedia" is
  interesting.
-   \#wikiwars Tsou: Ppl post things on WP, deleted, then on
  Uncyclopedia. "Why deleted? It's a good point!" But no orig rsrch
  allowed.
-   \#wikiwars Nishant: Not apathy towards politics, but towards
  politics as we understand it currently. WP falls into "flat, boring
  concept"
-   \#wikiwars Nishant: Uncyclopedia shows - not a crisis of leisure
  time. But they don't choose to spend their time on what "we want
  them to".
-   \#wikiwars Q: Why do ppl choose to edit Holopedia, not zhwp? Even if
  I'm TW, might still not match my daily language experience.
-   \#wikiwars "Language is continuous, not discontinuous, but we have
  to chunk it somehow. Trad: nationally. How do we deal w/this in WP?"
-   \#wikiwars Delicious lunch. Now my session is coming up. Will post
  audio+slides, think it will also be videotaped.
-   \#wikiwars Zimmerman. Finally sb. makes distinc. betw. information
  and knowledge. Knowledge is constructed in our minds, info can be
  shared.
-   \#wikiwars Zimmerman: You need to distinguish between anonymity and
  pseudonymity. Huge difference!
-   \#wikiwars Zimmerman. The old idea that Google and WP are making us
  stupid. I'm not convinced at all.
-   \#wikiwars Zimmerman: Have we lost sense of personal identity? --
  Wikipedia is collaborative, but tweets, blogs, homepages, etc?
-   \#wikiwars Zimmerman. Isn't this what Citizendium tried? They're not
  exactly racing alone...
-   \#wikiwars Niesyto: Wikipedia as Translingual Space
-   \#wikiwars Niesyto: List of 1000 articles that every WP should have.
  Too American/Western. "Edit each other's biases out of the list".
-   \#wikiwars Niesyto: Translingual dimension is somewhat "hidden"...
  Most people don't think about it.
-   \#wikiwars Niesyto: Actually did interviews w/ multilingual users,
  very interesting. Like to visit other WPs, even if they don't
  understand.
-   \#wikiwars Niesyto: Translation is betrayal... Have locally
  appropriate knowledge in each wiki?
-   \#wikiwars Just finished my presentation. Wow that was fast. IPod
  pinged at 15 mins just as I was on the last slide. Waiting for
  pushback :)
-   RT @ilya: Stian
  的演講給了在場的人們一劑強心針，尤其是開場的中文。不只我與其他的中文與會者，許多認同語言行動態度的與會者都拍手鼓掌。
  \#WikiWars
-   \#wikiwars My presentation Equitable governance of multilingual WP
  posted: http://bit.ly/64vecM (expand). Audio and video(?) will be
  added later.
-   RT @hfordsa: Scott Kildall and Nathaniel Stern:'Wikipedia Art lives
  on because of its death' http://wikipediaart.org/ \#wikiwars
-   Fascinating to what extent elephants became a topic/metaphore of the
  day at \#wikiwars. U subscribe 2 1-elephant or multipl-elephant
  theory?
-   \#wikiwars At the next conf, we should make all presentations with
  puppets.
-   \#wikiwars Artists talking about embodiment. Usually turns me off -
  but they make it meaningful.
-   \#wikiwars Focus on details - because it's beautiful. Interacting
  with real materials, and with other people. And in a structure.
-   \#wikiwars But general shape not pleasant. Like WP, we always see it
  "zoomed in", not from a distance?
-   \#wikiwars Wonder when I'll see most of the ppl in this room again?
  At Wikimania in Poland?
-   \#wikiwars We interacted with artwork in framework of wiki, but also
  used in other kinds of confs, which framed it differently.
-   Thanks to @cis\_india, the speakers, participants and just about
  everyone at \#wikiwars Hope to see you again :) (via @Srikeit)
-   Annotated video of \#WikiWars will soon be on PADMA http://pad.ma
  Official summaries, PPTs also on CIS site www.cis-india.org (via

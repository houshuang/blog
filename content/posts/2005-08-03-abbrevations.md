Just a quickie:

Even though I thought my command of the English language was quite good,
I was baffled by “PED XING” that was frequently painted on the roads in
Palo Alto. Turns out it means Pedestrian Crossing. Doh. Is there really
not space to write all of it? I happen to find Xing a very ugly
abbreviation. Kind of like every time a movie is subtitles in Spanish,
usted/ustedes (you in singular, plural) is abbreviated Ud/Uds. In the
same way, I found my brain always stopping up to process it, taking a
second extra. Probably just because I am not used to it.

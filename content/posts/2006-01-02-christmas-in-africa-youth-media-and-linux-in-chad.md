Two of my best friends are spending this Christmas in
[Chad](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad), helping a local youth
organisation use open source software
([Linux](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux)) and donated hardware to
produce a youth newspaper. Wojciech Gryc used to be my roommate the
first year in Canada, and is annoyingly brilliant (just try to [google
his
name](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&rls=en&q=%22Wojciech+Gryc%22&spell=1)),
and Emanuele Fortin is an awesome organizer with infectious enthusiasm.
Together they are doing awesome things this Christmas, and I am quite
jealous, but more impressed.

They have [a blog about their
undertakings](http://http://a13i.blogspot.com) that you can follow, with
pictures and all (the picture above was ungratiously stolen from their
blog - I will ask for permission post factum.) You can also have a look
at the international youth media NGO that Wojciech founded; [Five
Minutes to Midnight](http://i2r.org/fmm), or his [Initiative for
Interdisciplinary Research](http://i2r.org) (which seems to be falling
behind on the updates).

Either way, a very Happy New Year to Wocjiech and Emanuele in Chad (or
Ghana?), good luck with all your undertakings, and looking forward to
seeing you very soon!

![](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/22/24938735_34aee474ae_m.jpg)I’m not
a great programmer, but sometimes I come up with little neat tools that
might be useful to others. I am going to try to post more of them on
this blog, and I also made a page called [Tools and
hacks](http://reganmian.net/blog/140/), where I will be collecting them.

Here is the first one:

**Wikipedia language redirect**\
 Example:
[http://reganmian.net/redir/en/zh/Hamar](http://reganmian.net/redir/en/zh/Hamar)
(takes you to the article on Hamar (哈马尔) in Chinese Wikipedia.\
 Explanation: redir/from-language/to-language/article.\
 Example 2:
[http://reganmian.net/redir/it/ar/Democrazia](http://reganmian.net/redir/it/ar/Democrazia)
(looks up democracy (ديمقراطي) in Arabic Wikipedia)

Rationale: Supposed to be used through for example a Firefox shortcut
([http://reganmian.net/redir/en/zh/%s](http://reganmian.net/redir/en/zh/%s))
for your most common combination. I use it frequently for Chinese, when
my friend tells me he just made a great page about Moscow, or to find
out how they spell Plato.

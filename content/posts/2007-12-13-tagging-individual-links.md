So since I finally have a laptop that is actually mobile, I can now try
out the wonderful [Google Gears](http://gears.google.com), which allows
me to use [Google Reader](http://google.com/reader) in an offline mode.
This is great, I can catch up with my blogs on the bus. However, there
are still some problems. Pictures are not cached, that would be a nice
feature. Some bloggers only post parts of their post (very annoying),
and some blogs are essentially collections of links to other articles,
which I can obviously not read.

So in case I come across a post that has a great link that I want to
check out, I can tag it, and look at it later. But ideally, I’d like to
be able to only tag that link, and then have Google produce a link of
all links I’ve starred (with context). Then I extended this idea, and
thought of a Firefox plugin that would put a tiny star next to all
hyperlinks so that you could easily star hyperlinks in any document, to
return to them later. Or maybe you should be able to shift+click on it,
or whatever.

Just my tiny little idea for the day, from a pizza place in NYC, slowly
making my way home for Christmas.

am a big fan of [Cory Doctorow](http://craphound.com/)'s work. Without
planning to, I have actually read his entire oeuvres on screen. If I
ever came across a paper copy of one of his books, I would love to pick
it up, but I haven't seen one at the airports I frequent. It started
when I was living in China in 2004, I downloaded[Down and Out in the
Magic
Kingdom](http://craphound.com/?p=147 "Permanent Link to Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom")
and [Eastern Standard
Tribe](http://craphound.com/?p=148 "Permanent Link to Eastern Standard Tribe"),
and read them both on my 17" creaky Linux laptop, using a program that
very much resembles [Tofu](http://amarsagoo.info/tofu/) for Mac -
full-screen reading with columns and no scrolling (I hate scrolling when
reading a lot of text).

At that time, I was very excited by the idea that I could read
interesting, cutting edge stuff in English while living in China - in
the bookstores the only thing I could find were English novels that had
entered the public domain, Pride and prejudice and so on.

After finishing the two books, I breathlessly sent an e-mail to Cory to
express my appreciation:

> Mar 31, 2004, at 5:59: **Enjoyed your book**

> Hey,

Cory graciously wrote back and said he couldn't make a living off books
either, he was working for the [EFF](http://www.eff.org/), and that he'd
be moving to England, and hoped I'd like his other books.

I kept up with his short stories, his posts on [Boing
Boing](http://boingboing.net/) and so on, and a few years later I'm a BA
student (mature :) at University of Toronto, and I'm doing an internship
at a [co-op](http://www.healthwrights.org/projects/projimo/projimo.htm)
of disabled (but more able than most of us - I can't weld a wheel chair
from metal tubes!) in Northern Mexico. Part of my job was to help them
rehabilitate the internet cafe (which they used themselves, and which
was also a source of income, and encouraged interaction between all the
kids in town, and the people living in the co-op).

[![](http://craphound.com/images/someonecovermainsite.jpg "Cover Someone comes to town")](http://craphound.com/someone)We
helped them set up a satellite link, so their internet wouldn't go down
every time it rained (their phone lines were quite ... cantankerous),
and I remember sitting in the lab, helping them work on their webpages,
when I saw a notice that [Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves
Town](http://craphound.com/?p=150 "Permanent Link to Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town")
had been posted online. I pulled up the first page on my screen, to read
the introduction, and I couldn't stop. I think I sat in that shack the
entire day, until I finished the book and my eyes hurt.

I loved that the story was happening in Toronto, in Kensington Market. I
had spent a year at UofT, but living at the suburban Scarborough campus.
In fall, I was due to move downtown - in fact, to Kensington Market (the
coolest place in Toronto). I even looked up the location of the house
mentioned in the novel, on Google Maps. And although the concept of a
washing machine and a mountain procreating was a bit weird to me, I
loved the urban activism, the beautiful love story, the kids creating
mesh networks...

A year later, I was in Indonesia, working for
[CARE](http://www.careindonesia.or.id/http://www.careindonesia.or.id/).
While there, I began thinking a lot about offline access to material
(since I suddenly didn't have internet at home anymore). When I got
sick, I ended up listening to a lot of lectures by Cory, and they
inspired me to write another (and much longer) e-mail to Cory:

> Mar 4, 2007 at 10:19: **Re: Enjoyed your book**

Lot's of exciting ideas running through my head. I did a lot of work on
an offline Wikipedia reader, and after a lot of false starts and
problems, I came up with something that worked reasonably well. It was
based on the static HTML dump generated by Wikipedia, and you can see
the [screencast](http://reganmian.net/files/zipdoc.swf) or [download the
code](http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/03/07/git-gitoriousorg-and-zip-doc-offline-wikipedia/).
However, partly because it turned out to be [so
difficult](http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/ruby-talk/3479286)
to make a good cross-platform installer for the script, and partly
because there seemed to be other alternatives emerging, I basically gave
it up. Right now I have all of English Wikipedia on my iPod Touch
through the [Encyclopedia app](http://collison.ie/wikipedia-iphone/),
but it costs 10\$ per language, so I can only afford the English one -
not the Swedish, Italian, Chines, etc, as I would have liked. I still
find it amazing how little enthusiasm there is for a good open source
offline Wikipedia reader (for all platforms), given how much of a
difference this could make in less connected countries (all my friends
in Indonesia and India are excited about the idea, when I tell them
about it!)

As for my idea about offline access to Ruby, I talked with a lot of
Indonesian Ruby activists about this, and they were quite enthusiastic.
It even got included into the ["ideas for future
features"](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:HMklceXXICMJ:dev.blankonlinux.or.id/wiki/Pemaket/Komponen/BlankOnWikipedia-id+http://dev.blankonlinux.or.id/wiki/Pemaket/Komponen/BlankOnWikipedia-id&hl=en&client=firefox-a&gl=ca&strip=1)
for BlankOn Linux, an Indonesian distribution. (It also garnered [some
discussion](http://readlist.com/lists/ruby-lang.org/ruby-talk/12/62369.html)
on the international Ruby mailing list).I don't know if anything came
out of it, however.

Moving along. In 2007, I attended iCommons in Dubrovnik, and had a
chance to listen to Lawrence Lessig, Joi Ito, Yochai Benkler, and Cory.
I even ran into him briefly on the last day, and said hello. Then I
finished my BA, and the following summer, I went to China where I spent
time with the [Rural China Education
Foundation](http://www.ruralchina.org/) visiting two rural primary
schools, and writing [a
report](http://eprints.rclis.org/archive/00013684/) about their
fledgling community libraries (I was invited to do this, because of my
research on community libraries in Indonesia for my [BA
thesis](http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/09/20/mencerdaskan-bangsa-an-inquiry-into-the-phenomenon-of-taman-bacaan-in-indonesia/)).
In one of the villages, we slept in a new "compound" built for the local
village administration – one morning, I woke up by a man entering the
room, and sitting down at the PA system next to my bed, to broadcast a
message through all the loudspeakers in the village that villagers had
to remove the wheat they were drying on the main road within noon, or
face fines.

[![](http://craphound.com/littlebrother/cover-small.jpg "Cover of Little Brother")](http://craphound.com/littlebrother)Sitting
in the tiny school library, I downloaded [Little
Brother](http://craphound.com/littlebrother), and lay in bed reading it
on my MacBook until 3AM in the morning. This book is perhaps the one
that got the most mainstream attention, it even got translated [into
Norwegian](http://www.veslebrorserdeg.com/). Since I've always been
interested in language learning, and creating parallel texts, I got the
idea that maybe all the different translations of Little Brother could
be used to create a website for learning languages, and I sent my third
e-mail to Cory:

> Oct 4, 2009 at 10:49 AM: **Little Brother in many languages - language
> learning**
>
> Hi Cory,
>
> I've read all of your books, and love them. I even sent two copies of
> Little Brother to schools in Latin America, which was a brilliant way
> of supporting you and your publisher. I'm excited that Little Brother
> is getting official translations in many different languages
> (including Norwegian, my native language - I live in Toronto, but it
> was fun seeing the Norwegian twitterati getting excited about

>
> I definitively think you should link all these different language

> But to take this further... I speak a bunch of languages, and am very

> the right hand sides... This enables you to read much more interesting
> literature than your textbook, and you always have the translation
> available to check words, see how it would be formulated in another

>
> The problem is that it's extremely hard to come across such books. In

[![Cover of
Makers](http://craphound.com/images/makerscombinedsmall.jpg)](http://craphound.com/makers)He
wrote back and said that most of them hadn't been published yet, and
anyway it was hard to get foreign publishers to agree to license the
translations under open licenses. I still think this is a great idea,
try out [4Lang](http://reganmian.net/4lang) for one example (obviously
you'd want a much slicker interface) - it's A Doll's Home in Norwegian,
Russian, Chinese and Esperanto. You can at any time switch which
language is displayed on the left, and on the right, without loosing
your place. The interface is in Norwegian, but you should be able to
figure it out.

Back to Toronto, I began my MA at OISE, and I even got an iPod. I
remember reading [After the
siege](http://www.infinitematrix.net/stories/shorts/after-the-siege.html).
I finished reading it while walking down the street to the subway
station, and when I had read the last line, I had to stop in the middle
of the side walk and stand for a while. It was such a tragic story. I
was at a very boring conference, and checking my Twitter-feed when I saw
that [Makers](http://craphound.com/makers) had come out, I downloaded it
straight away to Stanza, and was reading the whole way home. The book
was incredible, I devoured it on my iPod.

[![Frontpage of For the
win](http://craphound.com/images/ftw_both_smalll.jpg)](http://craphound.com/ftw)And
today, I just downloaded his newest book [For the
win](http://craphound.com/ftw), and began reading it over lunch (on my
iPod again). An amazing story, and it's hard to put down, because you
want to know what will happen to General Robotwallah in Dharavi, the
Jewish-American who took a Chinese name and learned Mandarin to play
with a Chinese group, and is right now on the run from his father,
Matthew in Shenzhen... I look forward to
[donating](http://craphound.com/ftw/donate/) two copies of this book to
libraries that need them (brilliant idea).

When I began writing this post, I was actually going to talk about a
kind of fiction that I think Doctorow exemplifies, and so I began
talking about when I first read Cory's novel. As I began sifting through
old e-mails to figure out exactly where I was, and what I wrote to him,
I thought it might be fun to just turn this into a "around the world
with Cory's writings" blog post. I'll write that other post later.

I look forward to many more excellent books, and I am excited to see in
which strange places I will be reading them, and on what futuristic
devices!

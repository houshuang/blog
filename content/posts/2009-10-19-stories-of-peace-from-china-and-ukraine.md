I think it is funny how people often laugh at Youtube and other video
sharing sites -- sure, you can spend many minutes watching
lightsaber-wielding nerds or college students barfing, but you can also
find incredible clips that you would have never seen otherwise. These
two days, I came across two amazing performances that I wanted to share,
which both center around peace and onflict. The first is a Chinese
animation about the futility and brutality of warfare. For some reason
it is called [Beat a big
melon](http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMTI0MTc4MDAw.html).

The second is [an incredible
performance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cri7aQHRT7k&fmt=22) by the
winner of the Ukrainian version of "Got Talent", a sand painting about
the German invasion of Ukraine. I have seen sand paintings before (and
always been amazed and enjoyed them very much), but I have never seen
one tell such a poignant story as here.

I have not embedded these two videos, because I really want you to see
them in full-screen mode (there is a button on both players that enable
this). I also don't want to go on about these movies -- just go watch
them.

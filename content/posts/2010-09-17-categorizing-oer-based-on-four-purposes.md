This part of my thesis is based on a framework that I have gradually
developed over the last year and a half. It began with reading Mike
Caulfield's blog post [Openness as reuse, and openness as
transparency](http://mikecaulfield.com/2009/01/25/openness-as-reuse-and-openness-as-transparency/),
where he contrasted the purposes of MIT OpenCourseWare and CMU's [Open
Learning Initiative](http://oli.web.cmu.edu/openlearning/).
Interestingly, this was inspired by the same [course on open
education](http://www.opencontent.org/wiki/index.php?title=Intro_Open_Ed_Syllabus)
by David Wiley, that inspired me to begin research Chinese OER. He
introduced the notion of OER projects having different purposes, and
suggested that the main purpose of OCW was transparency, seeing what
other people had done. OLI, he suggested, was more about reuse. About
half a year later, I was giving a major talk at my institution about
Open Educational Resources, and in thinking through how I could give a
systematic overview of the field, I came up with three purposes of OER:
Direct use, reuse and transparency

[audio](http://www.archive.org/download/OpenEducationAroundTheWorld/Slotta.mp3),
this topic starts around minute 36).

As I began researching the Chinese project, reading the literature, and
talking with professors about the purposes of that project, I realized I
had to add another purpose, which I eventually decided to call
transformative production: the changes in the people who produce the
materials, caused by the participation in the production and opening of
the materials. While I believe this effect is to some extent inherent in
all OER projects, the Chinese project was the first one where I saw this
as explicitly stated, and put front and center.

I also become very convinced of the value of this analytical framework,
when I read a number of Chinese papers that criticized or evaluated the
Chinese project, but failed to discuss what the purpose should be. Some
would criticize it for not being very suited for independent learning by
students, when the initial project plans had never called for material
useful to that group. I believe that it is impossible to fulfill all
four purposes equally well (although you could probably do two or
three), and that by not making an explicit choice, you end up with a
project that does nothing very well:

> There are many models for developing Open Educational Resources, and
> this is partly because the goals of the various projects are
> different. To make this clearer, I propose a typology of Open
> Educational Resources based on their purpose. When people develop Open
> Educational Resources, they make many decisions regarding format,
> scope, organization, licensing and so on, and these are informed by
> the purpose the resource is to fulfill, as well as technological and
> organizational limitations. After publication, the resource can be
> used in many other ways by different users, indeed one of the
> strengths of the open licenses is to enable this kind of unexpected
> use and reuse, however the original purpose is still a useful guide.
> To be clear about the purpose is not only important for the design of
> the project, but is also a necessity for any rigorous evaluation to
> take place.

I first introduce the category of transformative production, which I
added after beginning to research the Chinese project:

> By **transformative production**, I mean that the process of producing
> the resource in itself has a transformative effect upon the people
> involved in the production process. Just as the purpose of writing an
> essay in school is not to generate a large amount of finished essays,
> but rather in the effect on the person writing the essay, this
> category suggests that the purpose of the production of open
> resources, or the opening of existing resources, is the effect it will
> have on those involved. This effect is always present even
> unintentionally, and could be positive – where teachers put more
> efforts into their teaching, because they know they are being filmed
> – or negative – when teachers abstain from experimenting in class,
> because they are afraid of having their failures caught on tape.
> However, this category covers projects that have this transformative
> effect as their main goal for the production of open resources. It is
> different from the three that follow, which all pertain to the
> resources after they have been produced.

My second category was direct use by independent learners. I realize
that independent learners can learn from almost anything, no matter how
poorly organized or incomplete, however we would expect something more
from material that had been designed with independent learners in mind.

> By **direct use**, I mean that the student can visit the resource and
> use it to learn independently. This means that the resource would
> ideally contain all the material needed to learn, ie. be complete. The
> resource should also be developed for the web, taking advantage of the
> possibilities offered by interactive quizzes, simulations, games, and
> other mechanisms. Developing this material might be expensive, and it
> should be clearly targeted to a specific group. A good example in this
> category is the Carnegie Mellon Open Learning Initiative courses (see
> for example Dollar and Steif 2008).

The Open Learning Initiative is a classical example, because it not only
provides a complete resource, but it also has interactive exercises,
simulations and animations that aid the learner. These resources can be
immensely powerful for a large amount of students, but it's extremely
expensive, and requires a number of specialized skills to achieve.

> By **reuse**, I mean that the material can be modified, redacted, and
> integrated with other material. In this case, the student does not

Reuse is kind of the holy grail of the OER movement, and the main reason
why we care so much about open licenses. The sad truth is that very
little reuse is happening, however, and most institutions are happier
producing their own branded material from scratch, than improving on
somebody else's material. In Mike's original blog post, he suggested a
difference between scripting languages and object oriented modules as an
analogy to the difference between packaged learning objects with
meta-data, and "just give me your stuff". He elaborated on this in his
[second blog
post](http://mikecaulfield.com/2009/01/27/more-on-transparency-vs-reuse/):

In some presentations, I have differentiated between "light reuse" and
"heavy reuse". By light reuse, I mean deep-linking to a resource,
putting it into another curricular context, but not changing the
resource itself. This is what David Wiley did with the original Intro to
open ed course, he didn't produce any of the readings himself, he linked
to reports, videos and other material that already existed. He didn't
modify these resources, but he put them into a new context. Light reuse
is much easier to do, and does not require the object you are linking
to, to have an open license (as long as it is freely available, ideally
without a login).

This is also what we are doing at P2PU currently, and what I have often
suggested could be done with the open courses in China... If you
criticize them for not being good, or complete enough, why don't you
create your own curriculum. There might be 20 courses on intro to
economics, why don't you go through and choose the best videos, the best
PDFs, the best examples, and link them together into a new curriculum?
It's completely legal, and extremely useful to others. This would be
similar to the object oriented metaphore, except in this case, we are
not asking for the resources to be heavily packaged meta-data labeled
learning objects, it's enough that they are on the web, and are direct
linkable.

Heavy reuse, on the other hand, means that you transform the materials
themselves. You might download them, edit them, take out chunks, put
them together with other resources etc. This is much more
labor-intensive, and requires that the material is licensed under an
open license. The most common form of heavy reuse, is translation.

You can read more about the textbook repositories in
[India](http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/04/06/many-great-free-textbooks-from-india/)
and
[Indonesia](http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/03/19/407-indonesian-textbooks-openly-available/)
on my blog. You could say that there is a lot of overlap in terms of the
material that might be made available under reuse, and
transparency/consultation. In both cases, we want as much material as
possible, don't worry about whether it's useful or not. And this is why
the purposes of direct use on the one hand, and reuse and
transparency/consultation on the other hand, can never be served well by
the same project. Mike Caulfield
[says](http://mikecaulfield.com/2009/01/25/openness-as-reuse-and-openness-as-transparency/):

> *It would be tempting to say that while separable concepts, the aims
> of reuse and transparency are so synergistic as to never be at odds.
> But this isn’t the case. Engineering for reuse takes a certain type of
> investment that constitutes a drag on transparency efforts.
> Transparency is most effective when as much is made transparent as
> possible. The principle behind transparency is that you never know
> what bit of internal information may be valuable to outsiders. And you
> shouldn’t really spend too much time worrying about it — get as much
> open as you can.*

Leigh Blackall
[commented](http://learnonline.wordpress.com/2009/01/27/reuse-dragging-transparency-and-decades-of-advancement/)
about the difficult of achieving both of these objectives:

> *At Otago Polytechnic we have been trying to achieve both at the same
> time, and some may have noticed that I use the term “open educational
> resources and practices” to encompass that intensive approach. There
> is a sense urgency in our need to update skills, awareness and

> drag in doing both.*

Although both reuse and transparency/consultation benefits from more
available material, they differ in some cases. It is not that important
that material in the transparency/consultation category use an open
license (although I personally prefer it). Perhaps the most important
difference is that the material in the latter category is valuable
because it reflects on something else. If I want to learn about how
American professors teach, and I watch OCW videos to achieve this, I am
not interested in the videos themselves, but in what they reflect (what
goes on in the classroom). Thus I can learn very little about how
professors at Carnegie Mellon teach classes, because the OLI material is
not a reflection of what happens in face-to-face classes.

In a later section, I will use these four categories to discuss how the
China Top Level Courses Project, and the MIT OpenCourseWare models are
similar and different.

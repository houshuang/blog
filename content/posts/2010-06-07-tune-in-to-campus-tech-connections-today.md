[![](http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/breakdrink.png "breakdrink")](http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/breakdrink.png)I
was invited to discuss [Peer2Peer University](http://p2pu.org) at a
newly launched podcast about universities, technologies and student
affairs called [Campus Tech
Connections](http://breakdrink.com/2010/06/06/new-podcast-campus-tech-connection/).
According to the website, *"[t]he goal is to help campus practitioners
understand technology while becoming  active digital citizens".*They use
the [blogtalkradio](http://blogtalkradio.com) platform, which enables
people to call in during the show to ask questions, whether through the
phone (646 652-2342) or using Skype. The show will start at 8PM EST on
June 7th (today), and last for about an hour. Feel free to listen in,
and call in with questions and comments. The show will also be recorded,
and available later (I'll post the address here, after the show).

I've never been on a call-in radio show before (as anything other than a
caller-inner), so I'm excited! [Go

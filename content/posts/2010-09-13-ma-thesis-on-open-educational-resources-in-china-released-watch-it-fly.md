**The research** I have detailed my trajectory into the Open Educational
Resources movement many times on this blog, starting with the iCommons
summit in Dubrovnik in 2007, and the Intro to Open Education course
facilitated by David Wiley that fall. In addition to bringing me into
contact with the people and ideas that would eventually create Peer2Peer
University (which in these days is launching it's third cycle, with more
than 30 courses, and lot's of excited course participants and
organizers), it was also the beginning of something else. During David
Wiley's course, I read an MIT evaluation report that talked about how
MIT OpenCourseWare had been translated into Chinese, and was used
actively in Chinese classrooms.

This raised all kinds of questions for me, about appropriateness,
cultural difference or change, pedagogical approaches, etc, and I
decided to make this the focus of my application to the program in
comparative higher education (actually the program is in higher
education, but I also entered the collaborative program in comparative
education) at Ontario Institute for Studies in Education. I got
accepted, and was extremely lucky to be able to work with [Dr. Ruth
Hayhoe](http://bellsouthpwp.net/h/a/hayhoe/), a leading expert on higher
education in China, and an incredibly inspiring academic.

I began my studies in September 2008, but already in April 2008, I had
the opportunity to attend an international meeting on Open Educational
Resources in China, where I made many important initial contacts, both
in the international OER movement, and in the Chinese research
environment. I then began trying to unravel what was actually happening
with these MIT courses, who were using them and how, etc. However, it
was very difficult to find concrete examples of courses taught with MIT
materials, and I had to abandon this line of inquiry. However, in the
process I learnt about something called "China Quality OpenCourseWare" â€“
indigenously produced open courses from Chinese universities. I changed
the focus of my thesis to look at this project, how had MIT inspired the
Chinese, how had the Chinese changed the North-American idea to better
fit their own context, and what could this tell us about the large-scale
changes that Chinese higher education was undergoing at the moment?

This is what I have been working on for the past two years. It's been an
incredibly interesting, and at times very frustrating journey. Almost
nothing of what I believed at the outset, turned out to be the case, and
I had to update my research questions many times. I was lucky enough to
get Dr. Jim Slotta on my committee as a second reader, and he helped me
think through the way we conceptualize Open Educational Resources. I
spent about 7 months in total in China, and developed wonderful contacts
and friendships with Chinese professors and graduate students, who were
incredibly generous with their time and insights. I also met the
frustrations of doing formal interviews according to a North American
research ethics approach, in a culture where that is poorly understood.

**Sharing the thesis**Anyway, the thesis is completed, and has been
formally approved. Since November 2009, all University of Toronto
students are required to submit their theses to the University of
Toronto institutional repository
[T-Space](https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/), where they will be
available to the world. This is a wonderful improvement on the old
system, and I whole-heartedly support it. However, my thesis will not
appear until after my convocation (in a few months), and will be limited
to one officially formatted PDF (I hate reading double-spaced PDFs on my
screen, and they don't play nice with Stanza). I get no statistics from
who downloads it, nor any opportunity to interact with the readers.

So I am going to experiment with other ways of distributing my thesis,
because I would very much like for it to be read. There are two aspects
to that. The first is the availability of the actual file, where from,
and in which formats. When I had finished my [undergraduate
thesis](http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/09/20/mencerdaskan-bangsa-an-inquiry-into-the-phenomenon-of-taman-bacaan-in-indonesia/)
about community libraries in Indonesia, I made sure to distribute it
widely, and others have also helped me distribute it, so that it is
currently available from for example
[T-Space](https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/10319),
[Eprints in Library and Information
Science](http://eprints.rclis.org/14659/), [Google
Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=qKicTROMHX4C&pg=PP1&dq=stian+haklev&hl=en&ei=IJeOTPanFdGgnge00PDoCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=stian%20haklev&f=false),
[Scribd](http://www.scribd.com/doc/10904329/Mencerdaskan-Bangsa-an-inquiry-into-the-phenomenon-of-Taman-Bacaan-in-Indonesia),
and somehow there is even[a physical
copy](http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4495338) on the shelves of the
National Library of Australia (no idea how it ended up there!).

The other aspect of distribution is making the contents accessible to
people. My first thesis was translated into Indonesian, this is
something I early [committed to
doing](http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/03/07/a-fair-trade-logo-for-academic-research/),
and still is very important. Many of the people who assisted me in China
do not speak English fluently, and even those who do, might not be
comfortable reading a 100 page academic thesis in English (I speak
Chinese fluently, but if you give me a book to read, it's a month's
project). I very much want to get the current thesis translated as well,
but it might take a few months before I am able to arrange it.

What I didn't do with the first thesis, was to offer it in any other
file formats (especially editable file formats). I also didn't do much
to popularize the contents, other than writing a short note for a
newsletter, and breaking it into two journal articles. With the current
thesis, I plan to experiment with going further. Firstly, I am making
both the original thesis, and an edited version which contains most of
the same information in half the number of pages available, in a number
of file formats.

I am also planning to publish a range of extra material. Some of this
will be background material from the research, for example almost my
entire collection of notes and raw research data (I still need to go
through to make sure it does not contain any confidential material), as
well as the full text of all the interviews I conducted. I will write a
number of blog posts, highlighting various aspects of the thesis,
possibly accompanied with audiovisual material, such as interviews
conducted with experts in different fields, screencasts, etc. And just
as last time, I will experiment with distributing the thesis widely,
especially as an ebook (ePub version is coming very soon).

I hope you will take the time to read the thesis, and I would love to
have your comments! All information that will be published about the
thesis, will be accessible from the [central
page](http://reganmian.net/blog/the-chinese-national-top-level-courses-project),
and all blog posts will be in the category [MA
thesis](http://reganmian.net/blog/category/ma-thesis), which also has
its own [RSS feed](http://reganmian.net/blog/category/ma-thesis/feed).

I welcome all ideas, feedback, criticism, comments and questions. You

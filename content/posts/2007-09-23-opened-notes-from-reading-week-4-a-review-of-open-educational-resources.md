[A Review of the Open Educational Resources (OER) Movement:
Achievements, Challenges, and New
Opportunities](http://www.oerderves.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/a-review-of-the-open-educational-resources-oer-movement_final.pdf "http://www.oerderves.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/a-review-of-the-open-educational-resources-oer-movement_final.pdf")

OLI - pedagogical approach, lot’s of interactive tools - supposed to be
used to teach a course, adapted by instructor, introductory huge
classes… can be self-learner too

success disaster - a teacher has access to 100 undergrad calculus
courses\
 *this has had a major impact on Chinese education - top ten
universities integrate 100s of MIT courses into their teaching* (really?
how can they make such a statement without any kind of source?)

situate OER not as separate from the courseware for enrolled students,
but as a marginal cost derivative of material that is there anyway

what is developing? the real definition isn’t country by country, but
urban vs rural.\
 open participatory learning infrastructure OPLI

elearning using cellphones in developing countries\
 computer games - immersive learning, AI tutors

*each of centers of learning are practicums, but are they reflective
practicums. Are they evaluating what they do and engaging in anything
resembling cycles of continuous improvement? Are their reflections being
captured and shared? Somehow we need to construct a shared, distributed,
reflective practicum—where experiences are being collected, vetted,
clustered, commented on, tried out in new contexts, and so on.\

 connecting students with lab tools through the net. fab labs.

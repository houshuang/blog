![Mastering the Machine Revisited
frontpage ](http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1853395072.01._SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg)

I think I found out about this book from the [Engineers Without
Borders](http://www.ewb.ca) discussion forum. (Actually, I read
Mastering the Machine, and then leafed through MTM Revisited to see if
anything was new.) It is produced by a foundation set up by E. F.
Schumacher, which works with appropriate technology in developing
countries. The author seemed to have a good sensitivity for what
appropriate technologies work and which do not. 

He gives a lot of
examples of practical problems and solutions, many of them none to
inspiring. NGOs and official development agencies are criticized for
being to idealistic, scorning commercial cooperation (be it local or in
the West), and not listening enough to local people. Sometimes
appropriate technology might be big, sometimes it might be small. The
theory of technology transfer is criticized, especially if that means
transplanting a factory into the middle of the desert. He implies that
what is needed for technologies to work is a whole ecosystem of
services, cobblers, repairmen and parts manufacturers - as well as
trained personell. This must grow organically (although we can help it
along), but cannot be kickstarted from nothing.

In this, he echoes the sentiments in [Jane
Jacobs](http://www.preservenet.com/theory/Jacobs.html), especially in
her book [Cities and the wealth of nations : principles of economic
life](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0394729110/qid=1114788621/sr=8-6/ref=pd_csp_6/104-4549694-0305532?v=glance&s=books&n=507846),
which is highly recommended. She lays out a whole theory of economic
development based around cities, and the “ecosystem of services and
trades” that Smillie only implies. I wrote to Smillie and said that he
should refer to Jacobs :).

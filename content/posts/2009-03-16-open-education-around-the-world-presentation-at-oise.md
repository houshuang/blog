I gave a talk about open education around the world, with Jim Slotta, at
the Education Commons/OISE last week. I posted [the links for all the
different
projects](http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/03/12/links-from-the-talk-open-education-around-the-world/)
mentioned during this talk, and the link to [the slides on
SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/houshuang/open-education-around-the-world),
and even wrote about the process of [creating the little Open education
videos around the world
video](http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/03/16/open-education-videos-around-the-world-the-making-of/).
But none of this made too much sense without the actual talk, and now
it's finally available. If you have the time, I think you'll find a fair
amount of interesting stuff - even if you're familiar with the open
education movement - because I try to include a lot of interesting
international examples.

Unfortunately, the recording system is built-in to the room, and it
allows for no post-editing, so there is about 2,5 minutes of silence at
the beginning of the recording, and apparently there is no way to remove
this. So just be patient. The entire discussion, which was fairly
interesting, was also recorded.

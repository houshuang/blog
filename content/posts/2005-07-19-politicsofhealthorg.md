The website that I have been working with all summer is now up -
surprisingly fast, due to a little hacker attack that took down the
previous site. What I have been doing is changing over from EZPublish,
an incredibly powerful framework that nobody understood, nor used to its
full, and to Dokuwiki, a wiki-based system that is a lot simpler, but
fills our needs. I was almost done developing it on a separate server,
when our main system went down, and we decided to push Dokuwiki into
place. It also has some new features that we are working on, such as a
public part, where users can publish articles, a better functioning
forum, etc.

I am still not happy with a lot of the contents, but I am hoping that
the simplicity of this new package, will make it a lot easier to improve
the contents in the future.

And in a few days, I am out of here.

As I wrote
[earlier](http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/06/06/tune-in-to-campus-tech-connections-today/),
I was invited by Jeff Lail, Jeff Jackson and Laura Pasquini from
[BreakDrink](http://breakdrink.com/) to participate in their weekly
podcast, and discuss P2PU. It was a fun format, and I got some really
nice questions. I had a feeling we could have continued chatting for a
while, and they invited me back to a future show to give an update,
which I'd be happy to do. It was neat seeing people tweeting about the
show as it was progressing (although nobody called in with questions).

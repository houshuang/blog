Anna de Liddo and Simon Buckingham Shum, both of whom I met at Learning
Analytics 2011 in Banff, provide a very different take on the design of
collaborative environments, in [[ref:liddo2010cohere|their article about
Cohere]]. Instead of focusing on little kids "playing scientists" and
learning to think like scientists, they focus on actual scientists,
politicians, city planners and others who face "wicked problems" and
need to harness "contested collective intelligence".

This is a nice link from the field of CSCL to its sister-field of
Computer Supported Collaborative Work, and what I like about the article
is that it provides a great bibliography with links to a number of
articles that I would not have come across otherwise, and which I will
definitively take a look at.

I need to read more about collective intelligence, but I wonder about
how it compares to Knowledge Building. The focus on solving "wicked
problems" is similar. What is nice with Cohere is that it's designed as
a Web 2.0 tool, which let's you refer to lot's of different web sources,
it even works as a browser-plugin, as opposed to Knowledge Forum, which
is it's own "walled garden".

A lot of tech talk lately, but here is some interesting stuff from
China. First, [The Opposite End of China](http://china.notspecial.org/)
mentions [a report from the
NPR](http://marketplace.publicradio.org/shows/2006/03/23/PM200603233.html)
that there is now a high demand for rabbis in China. The reason - China
produces so many food items for consumption in the US that have to be
marked as certified kosher, certified by a rabbi. It remains to be seen
whether [the Blue Sky bar in
Wuhan](http://www.cnhubei.com/200601/ca989059.htm) will add rabbis to
their eclectic clientele of young foreign English teachers, middle-aged
French CitroÃ«n workers, African students on state scholarships and
young Chinese couples.

The same weblog reports on [the wild web in
China](http://china.notspecial.org/archives/2006/03/why_is_chinas_w.html),
where cadres at all levels download homework assignments in ideological
subjects, as well as “self-criticisms” that they can then modify and
hand in to their party officials.

Finally, the owner of this very neat weblog from Xinjiang brings us some
examples of [real Uyghur music, and “fake minority
music”](http://china.notspecial.org/archives/2006/04/uyghur_pop_and.html).
I borrowed one of the clips from him here below. (This brings back real
memories of eating grapes and raisins in orchards outside Turfan.) I
borrowed one clip from him, here:\

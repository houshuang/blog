[![](http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/OpenAccessWeek.jpg "OpenAccessWeek")](http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/OpenAccessWeek.jpg)This
week is not only the last debate of the US Presidential election, but
it's the international [Open Access
Week](http://www.openaccessweek.org/), now in its sixth year (initially
I think it was only a day). I've usually been quite an active
participant, but this year I'm not giving any major presentations (I'll
probably participate in a panel next week though). There are a number of
events both at [University of
Toronto](http://onesearch.library.utoronto.ca/oaweek), [York
University](http://yfile.news.yorku.ca/2012/10/18/york-libraries-organize-an-eclectic-series-of-events-for-open-access-week/)
and [Ryerson
University](http://library.ryerson.ca/blog/2012/10/open-access-week-ryerson/)
(OCAD University needs to up its game next year!). I won't be able to
participate in either, but two events caught my attention: [Talks on
open data](http://onesearch.library.utoronto.ca/oaweek#Monday) from the
Map & Data Library at the University of Toronto, and ["The Great Debate:
Should the blog replace the
book?"](http://yfile.news.yorku.ca/2012/10/18/york-libraries-organize-an-eclectic-series-of-events-for-open-access-week/) at
York University. I hope this latter event is recorded, I always enjoy a
good debate, and too often, Open Access Week events tend to be fairly
"one-sided". (The only challenge with that event is that academics
already confuse Open Access with blogging and writing for Wikipedia,
which, while very valuable activities, are not strictly what we mean
when asking authors to support Open Access).

**I thought I'd go through and link to some of my past presentations on
Open Access, many of them done during past Open Access Weeks, since they
are mostly quite relevant still. All have slides, many have embedded
audio, and some have notes as well.**

I gave my very first presentation about openness at the University Al
Azhar in Indonesia as part of the Linux Week there in 2006. [The
slides](http://www.slideshare.net/houshuang/presentasi-free-and-open-culture-al-azhar)
are in Indonesian, but are included for historical value. I gave [a
presentation about open learning and the future of
universities](http://www.slideshare.net/houshuang/open-learning-and-global-education)
for a class I was TAing in 2007, but the first real public presentation
I gave about these topics was for a group of high-level bureaucrats at
the Indian Institute of Public Administration in Delhi, in 2008.

The talk
**["Open
Research, Open Educational Resources, and Open Learning – Experiments
and Ideas"](http://www.slideshare.net/houshuang/open-research-open-educational-resources-and-open-learning-presentation-at-iipa-delhi-554807)** was
my first chance to begin to organize my ideas about open licenses,
different kinds of OER and open learning, and it's also the first
presentation that I have the audio for as well. It's also a presentation
that I've often referred to in subsequent presentations about the value
of posting presentations online. Since it was a major presentation that
I was giving for the first time, it might have taken me 10-15 hours to
prepare the lecture, and about 20 people were in the room when I gave
it. However, before starting the presentation, I simply clicked "record"
in [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/), an open-source
cross-platform audio application, on my MacBook, and recorded the whole
lecture. After the presentation, I uploaded the slides to
[Slideshare](http://slideshare.net/), and spent a bit of time syncing
the slides to the audio. In the four years that the presentation has
been available, it has been viewed by more than 6,400 people, favorited
by 11 people, and downloaded 130 times.

I spent the summer in India, and in fall, I began studying my MA at
[OISE](http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/oise/Home/index.html). I there
collaborated with my future doctoral supervisor [Jim
Slotta](http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/ctl/Faculty_Staff/Faculty_Profiles/541/Jim_Slotta.html) to
develop a two hour presentation on ***Open Educational Resources Around
the World***. Here I introduced the concept of accidental and
intentional OER, and a number of other dimensions, including the
typology of three purposes of OER (direct use, reuse and transparency)
which I would later expand in my [MA
thesis](http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses). This lecture was [video
recorded](http://142.150.98.64/OISE/20090312-100421-1/rnh.htm) (might
not work on all machines), and also has

I spent some time in China, and gave a number of presentations there
(all listed in [my central
page](http://reganmian.net/blog/publications-and-presentations/)), but
my first Open Access Week talk was in 2009, about ***Innovative Projects
in the Publishing of Open Educational Resources***. In this
presentation, I looked at different funding and organizational models
for OER projects, emphasizing an international perspective. Again [the
video was
captured](http://connect.oise.utoronto.ca/p98085499/?launcher=false&fcsContent=true&pbMode=normal),

That year I had a chance to return to the Indian Institute of Public
Administration, and I gave a talk about the importance of openness in
administration: **Openness: For your research and for India**, where
I tried to explain the transformative potential of openness through some
stories around Wikipedia, how I began an article on
[podsol](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Podsol), a topic I was not an expert
at, which later grew to become an impressive article, and also how the
fact that Wikipedia is openly licensed, and downloadable, enables
unintended usage, for example [using interwiki links to create
impressive
dictionaries](http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/02/16/release-early-release-often-english-chinese-dictionary-based-on-wikipedia/).
You can download [the
audio](http://reganmian.net/file/Talk%20IIPA%20Jan%204%202010.mp3), and
the slides are below.

The next year's Open Access Week was very busy. I did a workshop for
teacher candidates with Clare Brett on ***What can Open Access offer me
as a teacher?: A guide to Open Access and to education resources you can
use for teaching and professional
development **[(slides)](http://www.slideshare.net/houshuang/what-can-open-access-offer-me-as-a-teacher-a-guide-to-open-access-and-to-education-resources-you-can-use-for-teaching-and-professional-development)**,
and gave two substantial presentations. In **What It Means to be an
Open Scholar, and the Future of Scholarly Publishing**, I tried to go
beyond the traditional "green and gold OA, put your publications on the
institutional repository, etc", and look at expanding the definition -
publishing in many different formats and channels, and sharing data and
notes during the research process.

I was inspired by a quote by Gideon Burton about [the **open
scholar**](http://www.academicevolution.com/2009/08/the-open-scholar.html):

> The Open Scholar, as I'm defining this person, is not simply someone
> who agrees to allow free access and reuse of his or her traditional
> scholarly articles and books; no, the Open Scholar is someone
> who makes their intellectual projects and processes digitally
> visible and who invites and encourages ongoing criticism of their work
> and secondary uses of any or all parts of it--at any stage of its
> development.

I began by talking about my own experiments with publishing and
disseminating [my
BA](http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/09/20/mencerdaskan-bangsa-an-inquiry-into-the-phenomenon-of-taman-bacaan-in-indonesia/)
and [MA thesis in a variety of
formats](http://reganmian.net/blog/2012/02/08/results-of-a-1-5-year-academic-publishing-experiment/),
and then discussed [the open notebook science
movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science), [PhD
wikis](http://reganmian.net/wiki/Individual%20Academic%20Wikis), and
ended with some ideas on the future of semantic publishing, inspired by
ia. [Anita de Waard](http://www.slideshare.net/anitawaard). There is [a
video](http://142.150.98.64/OISE/20101021-120919-1/rnh.htm), [a detailed
blog
post](http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/10/24/how-to-be-an-open-scholar-oa-week-2010/),
and slides below.

I also developed a presentation about another topic near to my heart,
multicultural and multilingual resources for the international student
body at the University of Toronto, which I gave at both UTSC and UTM,
with the title **Global Open Educational Resources and the University
of Toronto as a Multicultural Institution**, talking about
multilingual students both as consumers and as creators of multilingual
open resources. A bit later, I had a chance to return to my
international high school in Italy, [the United World College of the
Adriatic](http://www.uwcad.it/), and give a version of the presentation
to the incredibly international (and passionate) student body there,
called ***Multilingual Open Educational Resources for a Multilingual and
Multicultural UWC. **Unfortunately I never got a recording, but the
slides are below, and I have [a very detailed write-up in a blog
post](http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/12/07/oer-for-a-multicultural-classroom-student-as-user-and-producer/).**

Later that year gave an impassioned three minute speech about why OISE
should adopt an open access mandate at a town-hall (the mandate was
watered-down to a policy, [which was eventually
adopted](http://reganmian.net/blog/2012/04/24/oiseuniversity-of-toronto-gets-an-open-access-policy/)).

I have given a number of smaller presentations on OA, mostly mirroring
the content in the presentations above. There are two final
presentations worth mentioning, relevant to OA, although on quite
different topics. The first is a presentation I gave to
[CIDER](http://cider.athabascau.ca/partners/cde) on the Top Level
Courses Project in China, the topic of my [MA
thesis](http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses), available as an
[Elluminate
recording](http://reganmian.net/files/CIDER-top-level-courses.jar), and
[a PDF link to the
slides](http://reganmian.net/files/CIDER-top-level-courses.pdf).

I was also generously invited by [George
Siemens](http://www.elearnspace.org/about.htm) to give a lecture in a
MOOC, and I choose this opportunity to explore ideas around
visualization and interaction with ideas individually, in small groups,
and in large networks. The final presentation was probably quite
scattered, but I think had a lot of interesting ideas. I wrote up [very
detailed notes](http://reganmian.net/wiki/Grappling%20with%20ideas), and
later also wrote [a paper based on some of these
ideas](http://reganmian.net/wiki/grappling_with_ideas-the_paper). Also
[see the slides on
Slideshare.](http://www.slideshare.net/houshuang/visual-discourse-cck11)

My own work on Open Access during the last one and a half year has been
focused on developing an academic workflow for PhD students that enables
sharing of notes, and through this work, I've thought a lot about the
need for a more open infrastructure for scholarly publishing, which I
hope to blog more about later. I began writing [a long
document](http://reganmian.net/wiki/Ideas%20For%20Scrobblr) about a
possible social portal for sharing publication notes, which I never
finished. However, you can visit [my PhD
wiki](http://reganmian.net/wiki), read about [the Researchr
system](http://reganmian.net/wiki/researchr:start), and you can also
check out the blog posts, and screencasts about the system below:

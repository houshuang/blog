I have written about information I found on brain drain, during my
research for a thesis,
[earlier](http://reganmian.net/blog/2005/10/02/ethiopian-doctors/). The
topic proved very interesting, especially as I started exploring topics
like the anthropological impacts of remittances on communities in the
developing world, and I would like to read much more about it. However,
every thesis has a deadline and a maximum number of pages, so this is
just a short survey of some of the things I came across. If you are
interested, it is [available
online.](http://reganmian.net/blog/files/Brain-Drain-Stian.pdf) I

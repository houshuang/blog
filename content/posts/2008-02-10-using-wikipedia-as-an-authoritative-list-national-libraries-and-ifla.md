Looking through a bunch of old PDFs I have downloaded, I came across
this little tidbit from the [IFLA Newsletter, June
2007](http://www.ifla.org/VII/s1/news/s1-newsletter-June2007.pdf):

> ***Help needed: Directory of National Libraries on Wikipedia**\
>  The Standing Committee has discussed the creation of a Directory of
> national libraries worldwide,\
>  taking into account existing lists such as that maintained by the
> European Library Service for the\
>  national libraries of Europe members of CENL (Conference of European
> National Librarians). We\
>  have now learned that a worldwide list exists on Wikipedia:\
>
> [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_national\_libraries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_libraries%20%20) *
>
> *\
>  We think this is an excellent basis for developing a list: since it
> is open each country may add its\
>  national library details and maintain them, thus avoiding setting up
> another infrastructure. We\
>  encourage you therefore to check your country’s national library (and
> other) details on this site and\
>  update – or create - entries as required. Please let us know your
> comments on the entries and help\
>  maintain an up-to-date list. As an example, the reference staff of
> the Swiss National Library ensure\
>  that the Swiss entry is accurate and up-to-date as part of their
> general information service mission.\

The
[list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_libraries%20%20)does
indeed exist. I think it is very forward-thinking of
[IFLA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Federation_of_Library_Associations_and_Institutions)
to have their members contribute to Wikipedia instead of setting up
their own list - with this effort we can ensure more high-quality
content in one central location. However, it of course awakens the
questions of editing articles about yourself. I suppose that nobody
knows the central statistics of the National Library of Norway better
than they themselves, and in one sense, it should be part of the job
description of someone there to keep their Wikipedia page up to date
with new numbers, facts etc. On the other hand - we don’t want anyone to
“take ownership” of a page because of their authority… What happens if
someone lists a national library that doesn’t fit IFLA’s definition of a
national library (conjured up example)? Ideally people will then hash it
out as equals - nevermind that one is a 14 year old, and the other is
the world library association. Will such encounters convince IFLA to go
off and create their own list somewhere where they are in full control?

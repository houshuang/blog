love how Web 2.0 and a lax enforcement of copyrights is making it
possible to access cultures from all over the world, I can see Russian
TV-shows, and music videos from Ethiopia, things that I could never even
buy before (perhaps in Toronto, if you knew exactly where to go, but
certainly not in Norway). Ideally their exposure to the world will make
people interested, and eventually there will be ways for these artists
and creators to earn money through their work - not by DRM or
restrictive copyrights, but through revenue sharing, voluntary payment,
etc.

I have been interested in Ethiopia since I had a very good friend in
high school from that country, and I snook into a few lectures on
Ethiopian history at university; I had no idea the country was so
special, and was flabbergasted to learn about the stone churches for
example.

Either way, I wanted to share some great music videos from Ethiopia that
I came across. ([More

I've previously posted all my tweets from different conferences, and I
thought I'd do it again with the [Learning Analytics
conference](https://tekri.athabascau.ca/analytics/). I don't know how
useful it is to others, but at the very least, it's a very useful
archive for myself. I tweeted much more in the beginning, and began to
[write more in the Etherpad](http://reganmian.net/blog/tag/lak11) later
- at the end I wasn't writing much of anything.

I made a
[screencast](http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/04/12/manipulating-list-of-tweets-with-textmate-with-screencast-2/)
of one way of preparing these lists.

-   @gsiemens In which building of the Banff Centre is \#lak11
  preconference tomorrow?
-   @courosa I fell off the lak course too early, from what I gathered
  though it's quite a grab bag. The conference will be interesting
  \#LAK11
-   Finally at \#Lak11, great place. Already buzzing with conversations
  and excitement. This will be fun!
-   Should be of interest to \#lak11 participants RT @eknight A Working
  Badge Paper (for your feedback and collaboration):
  [http://bit.ly/dG4Q9k](http://bit.ly/dG4Q9k)
-   @gsiemens recommends newcomers in \#elearning field to "go data" -
  that's where the careers will be. All the big companies hiring.
  \#lak11
-   \#lak11 "doing data analysis "to" the learner, vs. "for" the
  learner"
-   \#lak11 One of my concerns is that a lot of the "open learner
  models", etc, is based around guided discovery, tutoring. How about
  1/2
-   \#lak11 more open-ended inquiry based, constructivist learning?
  Training vs education vs discovery vs creation?
-   \#lak11 "As soon as you start measuring something, you change
  people's behaviour" - yes! One of my big concerns.
-   First mention of latent semantic analysis at \#lak11. Great - how
  does it tie in with semantic web and social web?
-   @dgasevich Could you share a copy of the '06 "Learning Object
  Context on the Semantic Web"? UToronto doesn't have access to
  fulltext. \#lak11
-   RT @sbskmi: Learners won't care about algorithms -- until an
  algorithm thinks you will fail your course and blocks your course
  admission... \#LAK11
-   .@dgasevich shows software tools loco-analyst
  [http://bit.ly/fF59m6](http://bit.ly/fF59m6) and intelleo
  [http://bit.ly/e8dRXb](http://bit.ly/e8dRXb) - fascinating \#lak11
-   Great conversations around coffee break@ \#lak11. Corporate
  training, \#CSCW, business analytics, research collab, \#OA, ... All
  connected!
-   For fun, I'll try to take notes in \#etherpad, feel free to jump in
  and add stuff: [http://bit.ly/hxleEj](http://bit.ly/hxleEj) \#lak11
-   Wish presenters at \#lak11 could use short urls on their slides,
  make it easier to type in on our side, before you change slides.
-   The \#lak11 visualization shows how little time I spent in the
  course, and how quickly I fell off.
  ariadne.cs.kuleuven.be/monitorwidget-lak11
-   "altruistic learning (MOOCs etc) vs competitive learning (for
  grades, curved, zero-sum game)" - see differences in collab.
  behaviour? \#lak11
-   \#lak11 "Participation is nice, but it doesn't really tell you what
  learning is happening - content analysis as well"
-   \#lak11 DataTel already hosts big datasets of learning interaction -
  wants more. Very interesting to \#P2PU.
-   \#lak11 Is there a common format to describe learning interactions
  across different platforms, to make it available to lot's of vis
  tools?
-   \#lak11 So many fun new tools to play with / explore. Hope these
  will be gathered somewhere (rather than having to mine all the PPTs)
-   \#lak11 Would be great to have a "speed-geeking" session where
  people can showcase their tools etc more intimately.
-   \#lak11 Oh oh, @psychemedia is up. I have a feeling my fingers are
  going to hurt from all the notes I need to take...
-   Great intro - "how can non-programmers do this kind of stuff,
  extract and analyze data" \#lak11
-   \#lak11 @psychemedia : "Data is a dish best served raw" - great
  slogan for the \#od \#opendata movement
-   \#lak11 "A way of having a conversation with data in a visual form"
  - something we are very good at (doing through vision vs through
  math)"
-   A few people are starting to help me keep notes from \#lak11 on
  \#p2pu's \#etherpad. Very fun, and useful.
  [http://bit.ly/hxleEj](http://bit.ly/hxleEj)
-   RT @malpaso: HIrst neglected to mention "transformation" (one
  structure to another) as a step. Not a trivial step for
  non-programmers. \#lak11
-   @aribadernatal Maybe. But would be useful with a list of data that
  these tools need, so we can know what to export. \#lak11
-   \#lak11 Note to self: read up on and play with ManyEyes.
-   How do you link your own data, if there is no unique identifier? If
  I want to writ about OU academics, how do I make it easy to link?
  \#lak11
-   \#lak11 Try to use consistent usernames. Not perfect (might not be
  available, someone could set up acct w/your username on new soc
  service)
-   \#lak11 Again, Twitter following isn't necessarily meaningful. I
  follow more than 800 ppl, but I don't read all of their tweets every
  day!
-   \#lak11 Retweets might be a better metric, but also not perfect.
  Would be neat if there were "twitter trends" showing me whose tweets
  I read
-   \#lak11 But Twitter doesn't know, because Nambu pulls down all the
  tweets and filter them for me.
-   \#lak11 It's funny how incredibly much easier it is to map Twitter
  followers, then to map co-citations in academic papers!
-   @gconole We need unique academic IDs, and unique paper IDs, and
  citations/papers need to use them. There are initiatives but ...
  \#lak11
-   RT @sbskmi: @psychemedia is the mashup DJ spinning his discs here at
  \#lak11 But is current SNA adequately tuned for LEARNING?
-   RT @malpaso: Endless data. Endless patterns. Endless visualizations.
  What's relevant for decision and action? \#lak11
-   @gsiemens Yes, there are others too. But haven't seen a single
  journal including this info yet. \#lak11
-   @sbskmi Philosophizing abt diff. ways of live collab. notes - wonder
  how would be different in Compendium etc.
  [http://bit.ly/hxleEj](http://bit.ly/hxleEj) \#lak11
-   RT @niklas\_karlsson: Data from the course \#Lak11 can easily be
  misinterpreted when personal interpretations are made.
  [http://bit.ly/fnAiLe](http://bit.ly/fnAiLe) \#lak11
-   \#lak11 Wonderful lunch buffet, and great conversations about the
  amazing surveillance potential of data analytics. We know your
  appliances!
-   \#lak11 One of the frustrating things to me is the disconnect
  between schools of education and teach&learn in higher education.
-   \#lak11 No link between Office of Teaching Advancement and School of
  Education at University of Toronto.
-   When where? :) RT @gsiemens Who's up for dinner/beverages later
  tonight? \#lak11 @mweller is organizing :)
-   One of the core questions of \#P2PU!! RT @rmitchell Who Does? ;) RT
  @aribadernatal: "Students don't *do* optional." \#LAK11
-   Brilliant. RT @dougclow @houshuang @rmitchell @aribadernatal
  Students don't do optional, but many learners do! d:-) \#lak11
-   Unfortunately \#p2pu etherpad seems to be unstable, moving notes to
  \#piratepad: [http://bit.ly/hH3EHN](http://bit.ly/hH3EHN) \#lak11
-   RT @technostats: @sbskmi - socio-cultural discourse analysis as a
  potential measure of knowledge acquisition. Very interesting
  concept. \#LAK11
-   Great talk by @sbskmi at \#lak11. Very excited by new platforms for
  "reflective deliberation" Use at \#p2pu? Potential4analysis&deep
  learning
-   I heard rumours in the corridor about hot springs tonight - I'm
  interested :) \#lak11
-   @gsiemens [http://bit.ly/f65vfu](http://bit.ly/f65vfu) \#lak11 Hot
  springs location
-   \#lak11 I find some of todays talks very interesting, others not at
  all. Wonder if others feel the same. Is learning analytics one thing
-   \#lak11 or several things? Are there clear overlaps/synergies? Or is
  this a collection of two different groups of people?
-   \#lak11 @gsiemens: Do we need different analytics for different
  disciplines? Is there no universal "learning science"?
-   \#lak11 gsiemens: Learners will game metrics. Me: only if the
  metrics are high stakes (ie. does it also apply at P2PU?)
-   \#lak11 gsiemens: Interesting disciplinary differences between
  socsci/humanities and CS in conference steering committe.
-   Great talk RT @sbskmi Theory-based Learning Analytics: \#LAK11 talk
  slides at [http://bit.ly/i8y4Ag](http://bit.ly/i8y4Ag)
-   RT @psychemedia: @gsiemens Presentation graphics may well be
  different to visualisations used in more analytic phase...? \#lak11
-   RT @CosmoCat: Don´t miss @dougclow ´s "The Learning Analytics Cycle"
  [http://t.co/6BCewhf](http://t.co/6BCewhf) - and notes from
  @houshuang [http://bit.ly/fTTLW6](http://bit.ly/fTTLW6) \#lak11
-   Starting collaborative note taking today here:
  [http://bit.ly/g2b2wC,](http://bit.ly/g2b2wC,) yesterday's notes are
  here: [http://bit.ly/hH3EHN](http://bit.ly/hH3EHN) \#lak11
-   \#lak11 @gsiemens: "@psychemedia is the McGyver of data" -
  absolutely
-   RT @lgully: Hirst: irony of course descriptions written for grads
  not students seeking info \#LAK11. Need discoverable info.
-   RT @lgully: RT @CrudBasher: \#lak11 Totally agree -\> Hirst -
  learning should be lifelong. Universities should keep a learning
  relationship with grads
-   \#lak11 "Predictors vs causes:predictors of learning outcomes may be
  useful for "diagnostic" purposes, but need not be causally related"
-   RT @opencontent: @JonElmSherrill We almost always have ~more~ data
  online, it's just significantly impoverished... Pick your poison?
  \#lak11
-   \#lak11 Finally a presenter using short urls, thank you
  @aribadernatal
-   \#lak11 Ah, it was [http://bit.ly/egV5Rt](http://bit.ly/egV5Rt)
  Mahout - thanks Andrew.
-   \#lak11 Reputation as a proxy for learning in informal learning
  contexts - Doug Clow. Very interesting to \#p2pu!
-   RT @Anna\_De\_Liddo: @dougclow I LOVE iSpot! We would need an iSpot
  for learning! what about laSpot: spot new learning analytics
  tools/theories! \#lak11
-   What does @dougclow have against power-laws anyway? :) \#lak11
-   Very dense talk by Dan Suthers on multi-level analysis. Just read
  his paper last night - lot's I don't understand, but fascinating
  \#lak11
-   \#lak11 Interesting design of sessions here - very little time to
  ask questions or involve presenters in discussions around their
  prezos.
-   For new arrivals, collaborative notes on \#lak11 sessions being
  taken here: [http://bit.ly/g2b2wC](http://bit.ly/g2b2wC) Feel free
  to join.
-   RT @psychemedia: SNAPP bookmarklet code
  [http://bit.ly/hSmBy3](http://bit.ly/hSmBy3) \#lak11
-   .@cteplovs @dreff Wish you both could have been here! But Ravi
  Vatrapu is doing a great job. \#lak11
-   RT @cab938: Bears as learners, what a nice example for a conference
  in banff \#lak11
-   Varatrapu: "Many ICT managers say that their IT systems are UNESCO
  heritage - cannot be touched". Now cloud-based, avoid problem
  \#lak11
-   CommonLibrary on Sourceforge (Phil Ice mentioned this):
  [http://bit.ly/gc0IfA](http://bit.ly/gc0IfA) \#lak11
-   That wraps up some pretty intense note-taking. Check out
  [http://bit.ly/g2b2wC,](http://bit.ly/g2b2wC,) feel free to add
  info. Will post on blog tonight. \#lak11
-   RT @psychemedia: Really nice idea - give students a VM instance
  within which to do course related activities... and track them while
  they're at it ;-0 \#lak11
-   @dougclow Not competition, complementarity :)Was just saying to
  Andrew that it would be neat to combine them to get sth more
  complete \#lak11
-   Internet seems a bit more stable - I'm trying collab notes on
  Etherpad: [http://bit.ly/dZtfdM](http://bit.ly/dZtfdM) \#lak11
-   Great conversation over lunch with @sbskmi, Dan Suthers, Ravi
  Vatrapu and @anna\_de\_liddo, lot's of new ideas. \#lak11
-   Hoping someone will announce some collective activities tonight
  (dinner, drinks, springs, night skiing, improv? :)) \#lak11
-   \#lak11 Sorry about note taking, feeling a bit overwhelmed by great
  ideas and things to explore. Luckily this is all being captured.
-   @dougclow Or maybe we should collaboratively create an interpretive
  snow sculpture that embodies the key lesson from the conference?
  \#lak11
-   \#lak11 Interesting UoC has drop-out rate of 40%. Wonder if \#p2pu
  can aim to beat that...
-   @xaoch It's a really nice hike, but I think it gets dark around
  6:15, and there is no lighting there. \#lak11
-   @sbskmi This is key even for \#p2pu, which uses multiple external
  platforms for courses. \#LAK11
-   @xaoch Easier if people could use same e-mails. Also need to get all
  the info in, not all services provide RSS etc. \#lak11
-   .@gsiemens Summing up \#lak11 with "intimate encounter with tree"
  metaphor. Field is indeed moving fast, and lot's of opportunities 4
  collab
-   We're thinking of going to springs at 6 (meet in lobby), and then
  for dinner/drinks if people want. \#lak11
-   Just back in Toronto after great \#lak11 conference. Now lot's of
  follow-up and thinking about conference themes. Stay in touch all!
-   RT @markmelia: Glass - a key component to ubiquitous learning in the
  future - maybe -
  [http://youtu.be/6Cf7IL\_eZ38](http://youtu.be/6Cf7IL_eZ38) - thanks
  to tony bates for sharing \#lak11
-   Notes from second day of \#lak11 posted:
  [http://bit.ly/gkfwxV.](http://bit.ly/gkfwxV.) Hope to write more
  reflective blog posts soonish. \#oer

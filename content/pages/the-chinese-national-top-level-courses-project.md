<a id=abstract>**Abstract**

The Top Level Quality Project (jingpin kecheng, 精品课程)
is a large project in Chinese higher education which uses the production
of Open Educational Resources to improve the quality of undergraduate
education.

Widely understood in the West to be a form of OpenCourseWare inspired by
MIT’s example, this work traces the roots of the project back to the
history of Russian influence on Chinese higher education, the
introduction of course evaluation systems in 1985, a string of
large-scale funding projects to promote excellence in the 1990’s, and
the massification of higher education from 1988 to 1998.

After a detailed description of the project, the thesis suggests that
university teaching is conceptualized very differently in North America
and in China, drawing parallels both to the historical French and German
models of the university, and to the Chinese tradition of using “models”
to promote virtue and excellence.

<a id=about>**About the thesis, and this page**

This thesis, with the full title
*"The Chinese National Top Level Courses Project: Using Open Educational
Resources to Promote Quality in Undergraduate Teaching"*, was submitted
for a degree of Masters of Art at the [Department of Theory and Policy
Studies](http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/tps/Home/index.html), Ontario
Institute for Studies in Education, University of Toronto in September
2010. I am making it available here in a number of different formats,
all licensed under the [Creative Commons BY 3.0
license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).

This page will be the central location for information around the thesis
– I have written a number of blog posts about parts of the thesis. I
have also released most of my raw research data and notes. Finally, I am
experimenting with a number of different formats and channels for
distributing the thesis itself, and will be documenting that here. All
blog posts will be listed on this page, and will also be available in
the [MA thesis category](http://reganmian.net/blog/category/ma-thesis/)
([RSS feed](http://reganmian.net/blog/category/ma-thesis/feed)). I
welcome all comments, feedback and criticism – both about the contents
of the thesis, and about the different formats, distribution methods,
etc.

<a id=downloads>**Downloads**

Currently, the thesis is available in two
"editions", and multiple file formats. The canonical version is the
complete PDF, which is the only version that has been formally approved
by my committee, and which will be available on University of Toronto's
institutional repository [T-Space](https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/)
in a few months. The two-column edition is a paired down edition which
does not have the acknowledgments, table of contents or appendices
(ethics review documents), and has a much denser formatting. With 44
pages, instead of the 101 pages of the full version, it is much better
suited for printing. Of course, you can create your own versions, since
I also give you both editions in editable file formats. EPub and other
ebook-formats are coming very shortly.

<a id=journal>**Journal article**

Together with Wang Long, a professor from the Chinese People's Public
Security University in Beijing, who has a long experience with
researching the Chinese Top Level Courses and publishing in Chinese, I
published an article in the British Journal of Educational Technology.
This is not a direct extract from the thesis, since we began writing it
before the thesis was finished, and it is based on Wang Long's own
framework.

Hi, I'm Stian Håklev, a post-doc at EPFL, Lausanne. Welcome to
my blog.

**Background/academic interests**I grew up in Norway, and have also
spent significant time working and studying in Italy, Sweden, China,
Indonesia and Mexico. My undergraduate degree was in [International
Development
Studies](http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~socsci/int_dev_studies.html) at
[University of Toronto at Scarborough](http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/),
during which I spent a year working for [CARE International in
Indonesia](http://www.careindonesia.or.id/index.asp?lg=en&sb=1&dt=1&id=),
and my [honor's thesis](http://eprints.rclis.org/14659/) is about the
community library movement in Indonesia.

I did my MA thesis in the [Higher Education
Program](http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/tps/Programs/Higher_Education/index.html)
at [OISE](http://www.oise.utoronto.ca), with [Dr. Ruth
Hayhoe](http://bellsouthpwp.net/h/a/hayhoe/) and [Dr. Jim
Slotta](http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/depts/ctl/facultystaff/profiles/profile.php?lastname=Slotta&firstname=James).
My thesis focused on the Chinese National Top Level Courses project.
After completing the thesis, [I have been
experimenting](http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses) with ways of
disseminating it in several formats, and through many channels. In
September 2010, I began my PhD in the [Department of Curriculum,
Teaching and Learning](http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/depts/ctl/) at OISE,
with Dr. Jim Slotta. My PhD will focus on how to enable collaborative
peer-based learning around Open Educational Resources.

The [Peer2Peer University](http://p2pu.org) is an attempt to create a
platform enabling the collaborative peer-based learning mentioned above.
I was one of the original co-founders, and I am now part of the council.
I especially focus on coordinating research, supporting course
organizers, developing the pedagogical model, and partnerships with
other organizations.

I am also  interested in how knowledge production happens across
linguistic borders, and in promoting more exchanges between developing
countries and the developed countries. One of the aspects of this is
Open Access. I am a co-chair of the Open Access sub-committee at OISE,
and try to only publish my own material in OA journals, or journals that
allow self-archiving. You can find [most of my papers and
presentations](http://reganmian.net/blog/publications-and-presentations)
available online. I am also experimenting with making all of my reading
notes available through my [PhD wiki](http://reganmian.net/wiki), you
can also read about the scripts that power [the wiki/citation management
system](http://reganmian.net/wiki/researchr:start).
